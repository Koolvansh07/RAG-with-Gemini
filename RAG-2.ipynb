This principle marks a departure\\\\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a\\\\ngap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on\\\\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\\\\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\\\\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of\\\\na child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\\\\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue\\\\nimaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and\\\\nfreedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed\\\\non to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination\\\\nis one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\\\\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as\\\\nparticipants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\\\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.\\\\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\\\\ncalender so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\\\\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\\\\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\\\\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\\\\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages\\\\nwith greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\\\\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\\\\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\\\\nactivities requiring hands-on experience.\\\\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\\\\nthe hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book.\\\\nWe wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,\\\\nProfessor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal\\\\nfor guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development\\\\nof this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are\\\\nindebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to\\\\ndraw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to\\\\nsystemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT\\\\nwelcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further\\\\nrevision and refinement.\\\\nDirector\\\\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\\\\n20 December 2005 Research and Training\\\\n\\\\n4 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nANSWERS 5\\\\n\\\\nTEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE\\\\n\\\\nCHAIRPERSON, ADVISORY GROUP FOR TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS\\\\nJ.V.

It is the science not so much of the one\\\\nhundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules that\\\\nmay be built from them.\\\\nRoald Hoffmann\\\\nScience can be viewed as a continuing human effort to\\\\nsystematise knowledge for describing and understanding\\\\nnature. You have learnt in your previous classes that we come\\\\nacross diverse substances present in nature and changes in\\\\nthem in daily life. Curd formation from milk, formation of\\\\nvinegar from sugarcane juice on keeping for prolonged time\\\\nand rusting of iron are some of the examples of changes which\\\\nwe come across many times. For the sake of convenience,\\\\nscience is sub-divided into various disciplines: chemistry,\\\\nphysics, biology, geology, etc. The branch of science that\\\\nstudies the preparation, properties, structure and reactions\\\\nof material substances is called chemistry.\\\\nDEVELOPMENT OF CHEMISTRY\\\\nChemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old\\\\ndiscipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather\\\\nit came up as a result of search for two interesting things:\\\\ni. Philosopher’s stone (Paras) which would convert\\\\nall baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold.\\\\nii.‘Elexir of life’ which would grant immortality.\\\\nPeople in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many\\\\nscientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern\\\\nscience. They applied that knowledge in various walks of\\\\nlife. Chemistry developed mainly in the form of Alchemy\\\\nand Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE. Modern\\\\nchemistry took shape in the 18th century Europe, after a\\\\nfew centuries of alchemical traditions which were\\\\nintroduced in Europe by the Arabs.\\\\nAfter studying this unit, you will be\\\\nable to\\\\n- •••• appreciate the contribution of\\\\n    India in the development of\\\\n    chemistry understand the role of\\\\n    chemistry in different spheres of\\\\n    life;\\\\n- •••• explain the characteristics of\\\\n    three states of matter;\\\\n- •••• classify different substances into\\\\n    elements, compounds and\\\\n    mixtures;\\\\n- •••• use scientific notations and\\\\n    determine significant figures;\\\\n- •••• differentiate between precision and\\\\n    accuracy;\\\\n- •••• define SI base units and convert\\\\n    physical quantities from one\\\\n    system of units to another;\\\\n- •••• explain various laws of chemical\\\\n    combination;\\\\n- •••• appreciate significance of atomic\\\\n    mass, average atomic mass,\\\\n    molecular mass and formula\\\\n    mass;\\\\n- •••• describe the terms – mole and\\\\n    molar mass;\\\\n- •••• calculate the mass per cent of\\\\n    component elements constituting\\\\n    a compound;\\\\n- •••• determine empirical formula and\\\\n    molecular formula for a compound\\\\n    from the given experimental data;\\\\n    and\\\\n- •••• perform the stoichiometric\\\\n    calculations.\\\\n\\\\n2 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nOther cultures – especially the Chinese and\\\\nthe Indian – had their own alchemical traditions.\\\\nThese included much knowledge of chemical\\\\nprocesses and techniques.\\\\nIn ancient India, chemistry was called\\\\nRasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya or\\\\nRasvidya. It included metallurgy, medicine,\\\\nmanufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc.\\\\nSystematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in\\\\nSindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the\\\\nstory of development of chemistry in India is\\\\nvery old. Archaeological findings show that\\\\nbaked bricks were used in construction work.\\\\nIt shows the mass production of pottery, which\\\\ncan be regarded as the earliest chemical process,\\\\nin which materials were mixed, moulded and\\\\nsubjected to heat by using fire to achieve\\\\ndesirable qualities. Remains of glazed pottery\\\\nhave been found in Mohenjodaro. Gypsum\\\\ncement has been used in the construction work.\\\\nIt contains lime, sand and traces of CaCO3.\\\\nHarappans made faience, a sort of glass which\\\\nwas used in ornaments. They melted and forged\\\\na variety of objects from metals, such as lead,\\\\nsilver, gold and copper. They improved the\\\\nhardness of copper for making artefacts by\\\\nusing tin and arsenic. A number of glass objects\\\\nwere found in Maski in South India (1000–\\\\nBCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North\\\\nIndia (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were\\\\ncoloured by addition of colouring agents like\\\\nmetal oxides.\\\\n\\\\nCopper metallurgy in India dates back to\\\\nthe beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the\\\\nsubcontinent. There are much archeological\\\\nevidences to support the view that technologies\\\\nfor extraction of copper and iron were developed\\\\nindigenously.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Rigveda , tanning of leather\\\\nand dying of cotton were practised during\\\\n1000–400 BCE. The golden gloss of the black\\\\npolished ware of northen India could not be\\\\nreplicated and is still a chemical mystery. These\\\\nwares indicate the mastery with which kiln\\\\ntemperatures could be controlled. Kautilya’s\\\\nArthashastra describes the production of salt\\\\nfrom sea.\\\\n\\\\nA vast number of statements and material\\\\ndescribed in the ancient Vedic literature can\\\\n\\\\nbe shown to agree with modern scientific\\\\nfindings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver\\\\nornaments and terracotta discs and painted\\\\ngrey pottery have been found in many\\\\narchaeological sites in north India. Sushruta\\\\nSamhita explains the importance of Alkalies.\\\\nThe Charaka Samhita mentions ancient\\\\nindians who knew how to prepare sulphuric\\\\nacid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and\\\\nzinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron and\\\\nthe carbonates of lead and iron.\\\\nRasopanishada describes the preparation\\\\nof gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also\\\\ndescribe the preparation of fireworks using\\\\nsulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium\\\\nnitrate), mercury, camphor, etc.\\\\nNagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He\\\\nwas a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a\\\\nmetallurgist. His work Rasratnakar deals with\\\\nthe formulation of mercury compounds. He has\\\\nalso discussed methods for the extraction of\\\\nmetals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A book,\\\\nRsarnavam , appeared around 800 CE. It\\\\ndiscusses the uses of various furnaces, ovens\\\\nand crucibles for different purposes. It\\\\ndescribes methods by which metals could be\\\\nidentified by flame colour.\\\\nChakrapani discovered mercury sulphide.\\\\nThe credit for inventing soap also goes to him.\\\\nHe used mustard oil and some alkalies as\\\\ningredients for making soap. Indians began\\\\nmaking soaps in the 18th century CE. Oil of\\\\nEranda and seeds of Mahua plant and calcium\\\\ncarbonate were used for making soap.\\\\nThe paintings found on the walls of Ajanta\\\\nand Ellora, which look fresh even after ages,\\\\ntestify to a high level of science achieved in\\\\nancient India. Varähmihir’s Brihat Samhita is\\\\na sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed\\\\nin the sixth century CE. It informs about the\\\\npreparation of glutinous material to be applied\\\\non walls and roofs of houses and temples. It\\\\nwas prepared entirely from extracts of various\\\\nplants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were\\\\nconcentrated by boiling, and then, treated with\\\\nvarious resins. It will be interesting to test such\\\\nmaterials scientifically and assess them for use.\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 3\\\\n\\\\nA number of classical texts, like\\\\nAtharvaveda (1000 BCE) mention some dye\\\\nstuff, the material used were turmeric, madder ,\\\\nsunflower, orpiment, cochineal and lac. Some\\\\nother substances having tinting property were\\\\nkamplcica, pattanga and jatuka.\\\\nVarähmihir’s Brihat Samhita gives\\\\nreferences to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes\\\\nfor hair dying were made from plants, like\\\\nindigo and minerals like iron power, black iron\\\\nor steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel.\\\\nGandhayukli describes recipes for making\\\\nscents, mouth perfumes, bath powders,\\\\nincense and talcum power.\\\\nPaper was known to India in the\\\\n17 th century as account of Chinese traveller\\\\nI-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate\\\\nthat ink was used in India from the fourth\\\\ncentury. Colours of ink were made from chalk,\\\\nred lead and minimum.\\\\nIt seems that the process of fermentation\\\\nwas well-known to Indians. Vedas and\\\\nKautilya’s Arthashastra mention about many\\\\ntypes of liquors. Charaka Samhita also\\\\nmentions ingredients, such as barks of plants,\\\\nstem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and\\\\nsugarcane for making Asavas.\\\\nThe concept that matter is ultimately made\\\\nof indivisible building blocks, appeared in\\\\nIndia a few centuries BCE as a part of\\\\nphilosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda,\\\\nborn in 600 BCE, originally known by the\\\\nname Kashyap, was the first proponent of the\\\\n‘atomic theory’. He formulated the theory of\\\\nvery small indivisible particles, which he\\\\nnamed ‘ Paramãnu ’ (comparable to atoms). He\\\\nauthored the text Vaiseshika Sutras.\\\\nAccording to him, all substances are\\\\naggregated form of smaller units called atoms\\\\n( Paramãnu ), which are eternal, indestructible,\\\\nspherical, suprasensible and in motion in the\\\\noriginal state. He explained that this individual\\\\nentity cannot be sensed through any human\\\\norgan. Kanda added that there are varieties of\\\\natoms that are as different as the different\\\\nclasses of substances. He said these\\\\n( Paramãnu ) could form pairs or triplets, among\\\\nother combinations and unseen forces cause\\\\ninteraction between them. He conceptualised\\\\nthis theory around 2500 years before John\\\\nDalton (1766-1844).\\\\nCharaka Samhita is the oldest Ayurvedic\\\\nepic of India. It describes the treatment of\\\\ndiseases. The concept of reduction of particle\\\\nsize of metals is clearly discussed in Charaka\\\\nSamhita. Extreme reduction of particle size is\\\\ntermed as nanotechnology. Charaka Samhita\\\\ndescribes the use of bhasma of metals in the\\\\ntreatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been\\\\nproved that bhasmas have nanoparticles of\\\\nmetals.\\\\nAfter the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry\\\\nreached a steady state, but it too declined due\\\\nto the introduction and practise of western\\\\nmedicinal system in the 20th century. During\\\\nthis period of stagnation, pharmaceutical\\\\nindustry based on Ayurveda continued to\\\\nexist, but it too declined gradually. It took\\\\nabout 100-150 years for Indians to learn and\\\\nadopt new techniques. During this time, foreign\\\\nproducts poured in. As a result, indigenous\\\\ntraditional techniques gradually declined.\\\\nModern science appeared in Indian scene in\\\\nthe later part of the nineteenth century. By the\\\\nmid-nineteenth century, European scientists\\\\nstarted coming to India and modern chemistry\\\\nstarted growing.\\\\nFrom the above discussion, you have learnt\\\\nthat chemistry deals with the composition,\\\\nstructure, properties and interection of matter\\\\nand is of much use to human beings in daily\\\\nlife. These aspects can be best described and\\\\nunderstood in terms of basic constituents of\\\\nmatter that are atoms and molecules. That\\\\nis why, chemistry is also called the science of\\\\natoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and\\\\nperceive these entities (atoms and molecules)?\\\\nIs it possible to count the number of atoms\\\\nand molecules in a given mass of matter and\\\\nhave a quantitative relationship between the\\\\nmass and the number of these particles? We\\\\nwill get the answer of some of these questions\\\\nin this Unit. We will further describe how\\\\nphysical properties of matter can be\\\\nquantitatively described using numerical\\\\nvalues with suitable units.\\\\n\\\\n4 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n1.1 Importance of Chemistry\\\\n\\\\nChemistry plays a central role in science and\\\\nis often intertwined with other branches of\\\\nscience.\\\\nPrinciples of chemistry are applicable in\\\\ndiverse areas, such as weather patterns,\\\\nfunctioning of brain and operation of a\\\\ncomputer, production in chemical industries,\\\\nmanufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts,\\\\ndyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents,\\\\nmetals, alloys, etc., including new material.\\\\n\\\\nChemistry contributes in a big way to the\\\\nnational economy. It also plays an important\\\\nrole in meeting human needs for food,\\\\nhealthcare products and other material\\\\naimed at improving the quality of life. This\\\\nis exemplified by the large-scale production\\\\nof a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of\\\\npesticides and insecticides. Chemistry\\\\nprovides methods for the isolation of life-\\\\nsaving drugs from natural sources and\\\\nmakes possible synthesis of such drugs.\\\\nSome of these drugs are cisplatin and taxol,\\\\nwhich are effective in cancer therapy. The\\\\ndrug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for\\\\nhelping AIDS patients.\\\\n\\\\nChemistry contributes to a large extent\\\\nin the development and growth of a nation.\\\\nWith a better understanding of chemical\\\\nprinciples it has now become possible to\\\\ndesign and synthesise new material having\\\\nspecific magnetic, electric and optical\\\\nproperties. This has lead to the production\\\\nof superconducting ceramics, conducting\\\\npolymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has\\\\nhelped in establishing industries which\\\\nmanufacture utility goods, like acids,\\\\nalkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These\\\\nindustries contribute in a big way to the\\\\neconomy of a nation and generate\\\\nemployment.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, chemistry has helped\\\\nin dealing with some of the pressing aspects\\\\nof environmental degradation with a fair\\\\ndegree of success. Safer alternatives to\\\\nenvironmentally hazardous refrigerants, like\\\\nCFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for\\\\nozone depletion in the stratosphere, have\\\\n\\\\nbeen successfully synthesised. However,\\\\nmany big environmental problems continue\\\\nto be matters of grave concern to the\\\\nchemists. One such problem is the\\\\nmanagement of the Green House gases, like\\\\nmethane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding\\\\nof biochemical processes, use of enzymes for\\\\nlarge-scale production of chemicals and\\\\nsynthesis of new exotic material are some of\\\\nthe intellectual challenges for the future\\\\ngeneration of chemists. A developing country,\\\\nlike India, needs talented and creative\\\\nchemists for accepting such challenges. To\\\\nbe a good chemist and to accept such\\\\nchallanges, one needs to understand the\\\\nbasic concepts of chemistry, which begin with\\\\nthe concept of matter. Let us start with the\\\\nnature of matter.\\\\n\\\\n1.2 Nature of Matter\\\\n\\\\nYou are already familiar with the term matter\\\\nfrom your earlier classes. Anything which has\\\\nmass and occupies space is called matter.\\\\nEverything around us, for example, book, pen,\\\\npencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are\\\\ncomposed of matter. You know that they have\\\\nmass and they occupy space. Let us recall the\\\\ncharacteristics of the states of matter, which\\\\nyou learnt in your previous classes.\\\\n1.2.1 States of Matter\\\\nYou are aware that matter can exist in three\\\\nphysical states viz. solid, liquid and gas. The\\\\nconstituent particles of matter in these three\\\\nstates can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1.\\\\nParticles are held very close to each other\\\\nin solids in an orderly fashion and there is not\\\\nmuch freedom of movement. In liquids, the\\\\nparticles are close to each other but they can\\\\nmove around. However, in gases, the particles\\\\nare far apart as compared to those present in\\\\nsolid or liquid states and their movement is\\\\neasy and fast. Because of such arrangement\\\\nof particles, different states of matter exhibit\\\\nthe following characteristics:\\\\n(i) Solids have definite volume and definite\\\\nshape.\\\\n(ii) Liquids have definite volume but do not\\\\nhave definite shape. They take the shape\\\\nof the container in which they are placed.\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 5\\\\n\\\\n(iii)Gases have neither definite volume nor\\\\ndefinite shape. They completely occupy the\\\\nspace in the container in which they are placed.\\\\nThese three states of matter are\\\\ninterconvertible by changing the conditions of\\\\ntemperature and pressure.\\\\nSolid liquid Gas\\\\nOn heating, a solid usually changes to a\\\\nliquid, and the liquid on further heating changes\\\\nto gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas\\\\non cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid\\\\non further cooling freezes to the solid.\\\\n1.2.2. Classification of Matter\\\\nIn class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that\\\\nat the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can be\\\\nclassified as mixture or pure substance. These\\\\ncan be further sub-divided as shown in Fig. 1.2.\\\\nWhen all constituent particles of a\\\\nsubstance are same in chemical nature, it is\\\\nsaid to be a pure substance. A mixture\\\\ncontains many types of particles.\\\\nA mixture contains particles of two or more\\\\npure substances which may be present in it in\\\\nany ratio. Hence, their composition is variable.\\\\nPure sustances forming mixture are called its\\\\ncomponents. Many of the substances present\\\\naround you are mixtures. For example, sugar\\\\nsolution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures.\\\\nA mixture may be homogeneous or\\\\nheterogeneous. In a homogeneous mixture,\\\\nthe components completely mix with each other.\\\\nThis means particles of components of the\\\\nmixture are uniformly distributed throughout\\\\nFig. 1.2 Classification of matter\\\\nFig. 1.1 Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid\\\\nand gaseous state\\\\nthe bulk of the mixture and its composition is\\\\nuniform throughout. Sugar solution and air\\\\nare the examples of homogeneous mixtures.\\\\nIn contrast to this, in a heterogeneous\\\\nmixture, the composition is not uniform\\\\nthroughout and sometimes different\\\\ncomponents are visible. For example, mixtures\\\\nof salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with\\\\nsome dirt (often stone pieces), are\\\\nheterogeneous mixtures. You can think of\\\\nmany more examples of mixtures which you\\\\ncome across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to\\\\nmention here that the components of a\\\\nmixture can be separated by using physical\\\\nmethods, such as simple\\\\nhand-picking, filtration, crystallisation,\\\\ndistillation, etc.\\\\nPure substances have characteristics\\\\ndifferent from mixtures. Constituent particles\\\\nof pure substances have fixed composition.\\\\nCopper, silver, gold, water and glucose are\\\\nsome examples of pure substances. Glucose\\\\ncontains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a\\\\nfixed ratio and its particles are of same\\\\ncomposition. Hence, like all other pure\\\\nsubstances, glucose has a fixed composition.\\\\nAlso, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen and\\\\noxygen—cannot be separated by simple\\\\nphysical methods.\\\\nPure substances can further be\\\\nclassified into elements and compounds.\\\\nParticles of an element consist of only one\\\\ntype of atoms. These particles may exist as\\\\natoms or molecules. You may be familiar\\\\nwith atoms and molecules from the\\\\n\\\\n6 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nprevious classes; however, you will be\\\\nstudying about them in detail in Unit 2.\\\\nSodium, copper, silver, hydrogen, oxygen,\\\\netc., are some examples of elements. Their\\\\nall atoms are of one type. However, the\\\\natoms of different elements are different in\\\\nnature. Some elements, such as sodium or\\\\ncopper, contain atoms as their constituent\\\\nparticles, whereas, in some others, the\\\\nconstituent particles are molecules which\\\\nare formed by two or more atoms. For\\\\nexample, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen\\\\ngases consist of molecules, in which two\\\\natoms combine to give their respective\\\\nmolecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.\\\\n\\\\ncarbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different\\\\nelements are present in a compound in a fixed\\\\nand definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic\\\\nof a particular compound. Also, the properties\\\\nof a compound are different from those of its\\\\nconstituent elements. For example, hydrogen\\\\nand oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound\\\\nformed by their combination i.e., water is a\\\\nliquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen\\\\nburns with a pop sound and oxygen is a\\\\nsupporter of combustion, but water is used\\\\nas a fire extinguisher.\\\\n\\\\n1.3 Properties of Matter and their Measurement\\\\n\\\\n1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties\\\\nEvery substance has unique or characteristic\\\\nproperties. These properties can be classified\\\\ninto two categories — physical properties,\\\\nsuch as colour, odour, melting point, boiling\\\\npoint, density, etc., and chemical properties,\\\\nlike composition, combustibility, ractivity with\\\\nacids and bases, etc.\\\\nPhysical properties can be measured or\\\\nobserved without changing the identity or the\\\\ncomposition of the substance. The measurement\\\\nor observation of chemical properties requires\\\\na chemical change to occur. Measurement of\\\\nphysical properties does not require occurance\\\\nof a chemical change. The examples of chemical\\\\nproperties are characteristic reactions of different\\\\nsubstances; these include acidity or basicity,\\\\ncombustibility, etc. Chemists describe, interpret\\\\nand predict the behaviour of substances on the\\\\nbasis of knowledge of their physical and chemical\\\\nproperties, which are determined by careful\\\\nmeasurement and experimentation. In the\\\\nWhen two or more atoms of different\\\\nelements combine together in a definite ratio,\\\\nthe molecule of a compound is obtained.\\\\nMoreover, the constituents of a compound\\\\ncannot be separated into simpler\\\\nsubstances by physical methods. They can\\\\nbe separated by chemical methods.\\\\nExamples of some compounds are water,\\\\nammonia, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc. The\\\\nmolecules of water and carbon dioxide are\\\\nrepresented in Fig. 1.4.\\\\n\\\\nNote that a water molecule comprises two\\\\nhydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\\\\nSimilarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide\\\\ncontains two oxygen atoms combined with one\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1.4 A depiction of molecules of water and\\\\ncarbon dioxide\\\\nWater molecule\\\\n(H 2 O)\\\\nCarbon dioxide\\\\nmolecule (CO 2 )\\\\nFig. 1.3 A representation of atoms and molecules\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 7\\\\n\\\\n8 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nThese prefixes are listed in Table 1.3.\\\\nLet us now quickly go through some of the\\\\nquantities which you will be often using in this\\\\nbook.\\\\nThe definitions of the SI base units are given\\\\nin Table 1.2.\\\\nThe SI system allows the use of prefixes to\\\\nindicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit.\\\\n\\\\nTriple point of water is 0.01 °C or 279.16K (32.01°F)\\\\n\\\\nUnit of luminous intensity candela The candela is the luminous intensity, in a\\\\ngiven direction, of a source that emits\\\\nmonochromatic radiation of frequency\\\\n540 × 10^12 hertz and that has a radiant\\\\nintensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per\\\\nsteradian.\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 9\\\\n\\\\n10 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nIn the laboratory, the volume of liquids or\\\\nsolutions can be measured by graduated\\\\n\\\\ncylinder, burette, pipette, etc. A volumetric\\\\nflask is used to prepare a known volume of a\\\\nsolution.

These ideas are discussed\\\\nbelow in detail.\\\\n1.4.1 Scientific Notation\\\\nAs chemistry is the study of atoms and\\\\nmolecules, which have extremely low masses\\\\nand are present in extremely large numbers,\\\\na chemist has to deal with numbers as large\\\\nas 602, 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for\\\\nthe molecules of 2 g of hydrogen gas or as\\\\nsmall as 0.00000000000000000000000166\\\\ng mass of a H atom. Similarly, other constants\\\\nsuch as Planck’s constant, speed of light,\\\\ncharges on particles, etc., involve numbers of\\\\nthe above magnitude.\\\\nIt may look funny for a moment to write\\\\nor count numbers involving so many zeros\\\\nbut it offers a real challenge to do simple\\\\nmathematical operations of addition,\\\\nsubtraction, multiplication or division with\\\\nsuch numbers. You can write any two\\\\nnumbers of the above type and try any one of\\\\nthe operations you like to accept as a\\\\nchallenge, and then, you will really appreciate\\\\nthe difficulty in handling such numbers.\\\\nThis problem is solved by using scientific\\\\nnotation for such numbers, i.e., exponential\\\\nnotation in which any number can be\\\\nrepresented in the form N × 10n, where n is an\\\\nexponent having positive or negative values\\\\nand N is a number (called digit term) which\\\\nvaries between 1.000... and 9.999....\\\\nThus, we can write 232.508 as\\\\n2.32508 × 102 in scientific notation. Note that\\\\nwhile writing it, the decimal had to be moved\\\\nto the left by two places and same is the\\\\nexponent (2) of 10 in the scientific notation.\\\\nSimilarly, 0.00016 can be written as\\\\n1.6 × 10 –4. Here, the decimal has to be moved\\\\nfour places to the right and (–4) is the exponent\\\\nin the scientific notation.\\\\nWhile performing mathematical operations\\\\non numbers expressed in scientific notations,\\\\nthe following points are to be kept in mind.\\\\nReference Standard\\\\nAfter defining a unit of measurement such\\\\nas the kilogram or the metre, scientists\\\\nagreed on reference standards that make\\\\nit possible to calibrate all measuring\\\\ndevices. For getting reliable measurements,\\\\nall devices such as metre sticks and\\\\nanalytical balances have been calibrated by\\\\ntheir manufacturers to give correct\\\\nreadings. However, each of these devices\\\\nis standardised or calibrated against some\\\\nreference. The mass standard is the\\\\nkilogram since 1889. It has been defined\\\\nas the mass of platinum-iridium\", 'Brihat Samhita gives\\\\nreferences to perfumes and cosmetics. Recipes\\\\nfor hair dying were made from plants, like\\\\nindigo and minerals like iron power, black iron\\\\nor steel and acidic extracts of sour rice gruel.\\\\nGandhayukli describes recipes for making\\\\nscents, mouth perfumes, bath powders,\\\\nincense and talcum power.\\\\nPaper was known to India in the\\\\n17 th century as account of Chinese traveller\\\\nI-tsing describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate\\\\nthat ink was used in India from the fourth\\\\ncentury. Colours of ink were made from chalk,\\\\nred lead and minimum.\\\\nIt seems that the process of fermentation\\\\nwas well-known to Indians. Vedas and\\\\nKautilya’s Arthashastra mention about many\\\\ntypes of liquors. Charaka Samhita also\\\\nmentions ingredients, such as barks of plants,\\\\nstem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits and\\\\nsugarcane for making Asavas.\\\\nThe concept that matter is ultimately made\\\\nof indivisible building blocks, appeared in\\\\nIndia a few centuries BCE as a part of\\\\nphilosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda,\\\\nborn in 600 BCE, originally known by the\\\\nname Kashyap, was the first proponent of the\\\\n‘atomic theory’. He formulated the theory of\\\\nvery small indivisible particles, which he\\\\nnamed ‘ Paramãnu ’ (comparable to atoms). He\\\\nauthored the text Vaiseshika Sutras.\\\\nAccording to him, all substances are\\\\naggregated form of smaller units called atoms\\\\n( Paramãnu ), which are eternal, indestructible,\\\\nspherical, suprasensible and in motion in the\\\\noriginal state. He explained that this individual\\\\nentity cannot be sensed through any human\\\\norgan. Kanda added that there are varieties of\\\\natoms that are as different as the different\\\\nclasses of substances. He said these\\\\n( Paramãnu ) could form pairs or triplets, among\\\\nother combinations and unseen forces cause\\\\ninteraction between them. He conceptualised\\\\nthis theory around 2500 years before John\\\\nDalton (1766-1844).\\\\nCharaka Samhita is the oldest Ayurvedic\\\\nepic of India. It describes the treatment of\\\\ndiseases. The concept of reduction of particle\\\\nsize of metals is clearly discussed in Charaka\\\\nSamhita. Extreme reduction of particle size is\\\\ntermed as nanotechnology. Charaka Samhita\\\\ndescribes the use of bhasma of metals in the\\\\ntreatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has been\\\\nproved that bhasmas have nanoparticles of\\\\nmetals.\\\\nAfter the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry\\\\nreached a steady state, but it too declined due\\\\nto the introduction and practise of western\\\\nmedicinal system in the 20th century. During\\\\nthis period of stagnation, pharmaceutical\\\\nindustry based on Ayurveda continued to\\\\nexist, but it too declined gradually. It took\\\\nabout 100-150 years for Indians to learn and\\\\nadopt new techniques. During this time, foreign\\\\nproducts poured in. As a result, indigenous\\\\ntraditional techniques gradually declined.\\\\nModern science appeared in Indian scene in\\\\nthe later part of the nineteenth century. By the\\\\nmid-nineteenth century, European scientists\\\\nstarted coming to India and modern chemistry\\\\nstarted growing.\\\\nFrom the above discussion, you have learnt\\\\nthat chemistry deals with the composition,\\\\nstructure, properties and interection of matter\\\\nand is of much use to human beings in daily\\\\nlife. These aspects can be best described and\\\\nunderstood in terms of basic constituents of\\\\nmatter that are atoms and molecules. That\\\\nis why, chemistry is also called the science of\\\\natoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and\\\\nperceive these entities (atoms and molecules)?\\\\nIs it possible to count the number of atoms\\\\nand molecules in a given mass of matter and\\\\nhave a quantitative relationship between the\\\\nmass and the number of these particles? We\\\\nwill get the answer of some of these questions\\\\nin this Unit. We will further describe how\\\\nphysical properties of matter can be\\\\nquantitatively described using numerical\\\\nvalues with suitable units.\\\\n\\\\n4 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n1.1 Importance of Chemistry\\\\n\\\\nChemistry plays a central role in science and\\\\nis often intertwined with other branches of\\\\nscience.\\\\nPrinciples of chemistry are applicable in\\\\ndiverse areas, such as weather patterns,\\\\nfunctioning of brain and operation of a\\\\ncomputer, production in chemical industries,\\\\nmanufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts,\\\\ndyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents,\\\\nmetals, alloys, etc., including new material.\\\\n\\\\nChemistry contributes in a big way to the\\\\nnational economy. It also plays an important\\\\nrole in meeting human needs for food,\\\\nhealthcare products and other material\\\\naimed at improving the quality of life. This\\\\nis exemplified by the large-scale production\\\\nof a variety of fertilisers, improved variety of\\\\npesticides and insecticides. Chemistry\\\\nprovides methods for the isolation of life-\\\\nsaving drugs from natural sources and\\\\nmakes possible synthesis of such drugs.\\\\nSome of these drugs are cisplatin and taxol,\\\\nwhich are effective in cancer therapy. The\\\\ndrug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for\\\\nhelping AIDS patients.\\\\n\\\\nChemistry contributes to a large extent\\\\nin the development and growth of a nation.\\\\nWith a better understanding of chemical\\\\nprinciples it has now become possible to\\\\ndesign and synthesise new material having\\\\nspecific magnetic, electric and optical\\\\nproperties. This has lead to the production\\\\nof superconducting ceramics, conducting\\\\npolymers, optical fibres, etc. Chemistry has\\\\nhelped in establishing industries which\\\\nmanufacture utility goods, like acids,\\\\nalkalies, dyes, polymesr metals, etc. These\\\\nindustries contribute in a big way to the\\\\neconomy of a nation and generate\\\\nemployment.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, chemistry has helped\\\\nin dealing with some of the pressing aspects\\\\nof environmental degradation with a fair\\\\ndegree of success. Safer alternatives to\\\\nenvironmentally hazardous refrigerants, like\\\\nCFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible for\\\\nozone depletion in the stratosphere, have\\\\n\\\\nbeen successfully synthesised. However,\\\\nmany big environmental problems continue\\\\nto be matters of grave concern to the\\\\nchemists. One such problem is the\\\\nmanagement of the Green House gases, like\\\\nmethane, carbon dioxide, etc. Understanding\\\\nof biochemical processes, use of enzymes for\\\\nlarge-scale production of chemicals and\\\\nsynthesis of new exotic material are some of\\\\nthe intellectual challenges for the future\\\\ngeneration of chemists. A developing country,\\\\nlike India, needs talented and creative\\\\nchemists for accepting such challenges. To\\\\nbe a good chemist and to accept such\\\\nchallanges, one needs to understand the\\\\nbasic concepts of chemistry, which begin with\\\\nthe concept of matter. Let us start with the\\\\nnature of matter.\\\\n\\\\n1.2 Nature of Matter\\\\n\\\\nYou are already familiar with the term matter\\\\nfrom your earlier classes. Anything which has\\\\nmass and occupies space is called matter.\\\\nEverything around us, for example, book, pen,\\\\npencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are\\\\ncomposed of matter. You know that they have\\\\nmass and they occupy space. Let us recall the\\\\ncharacteristics of the states of matter, which\\\\nyou learnt in your previous classes.\\\\n1.2.1 States of Matter\\\\nYou are aware that matter can exist in three\\\\nphysical states viz. solid, liquid and gas. The\\\\nconstituent particles of matter in these three\\\\nstates can be represented as shown in Fig. 1.1.\\\\nParticles are held very close to each other\\\\nin solids in an orderly fashion and there is not\\\\nmuch freedom of movement. In liquids, the\\\\nparticles are close to each other but they can\\\\nmove around. However, in gases, the particles\\\\nare far apart as compared to those present in\\\\nsolid or liquid states and their movement is\\\\neasy and fast. Because of such arrangement\\\\nof particles, different states of matter exhibit\\\\nthe following characteristics:\\\\n(i) Solids have definite volume and definite\\\\nshape.\\\\n(ii) Liquids have definite volume but do not\\\\nhave definite shape. They take the shape\\\\nof the container in which they are placed.\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 5\\\\n\\\\n(iii)Gases have neither definite volume nor\\\\ndefinite shape. They completely occupy the\\\\nspace in the container in which they are placed.\\\\nThese three states of matter are\\\\ninterconvertible by changing the conditions of\\\\ntemperature and pressure.\\\\nSolid liquid Gas\\\\nOn heating, a solid usually changes to a\\\\nliquid, and the liquid on further heating changes\\\\nto gas (or vapour). In the reverse process, a gas\\\\non cooling liquifies to the liquid and the liquid\\\\non further cooling freezes to the solid.\\\\n1.2.2.

For getting reliable measurements,\\\\nall devices such as metre sticks and\\\\nanalytical balances have been calibrated by\\\\ntheir manufacturers to give correct\\\\nreadings. However, each of these devices\\\\nis standardised or calibrated against some\\\\nreference. The mass standard is the\\\\nkilogram since 1889. It has been defined\\\\nas the mass of platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir)\\\\ncylinder that is stored in an airtight jar at\\\\nInternational Bureau of Weights and\\\\nMeasures in Sevres, France. Pt-Ir was\\\\nchosen for this standard because it is\\\\nhighly resistant to chemical attack and its\\\\nmass will not change for an extremely long\\\\ntime.\\\\nScientists are in search of a new\\\\nstandard for mass. This is being attempted\\\\nthrough accurate determination of\\\\nAvogadro constant.

One such method,\\\\nwhich uses X-rays to determine the atomic\\\\ndensity of a crystal of ultrapure silicon, has\\\\nan accuracy of about 1 part in 10^6 but has\\\\nnot yet been adopted to serve as a\\\\nstandard. There are other methods but\\\\nnone of them are presently adequate to\\\\nreplace the Pt-Ir cylinder.

He performed careful experimental\\\\nstudies for combustion reactions and reached\\\\nto the conclusion that in all physical and\\\\nchemical changes, there is no net change in\\\\nmass duting the process. Hence, he reached\\\\nto the conclusion that matter can neither be\\\\ncreated nor destroyed. This is called ‘Law of\\\\nConservation of Mass’. This law formed the\\\\nbasis for several later developments in\\\\nchemistry. Infact, this was the result of exact\\\\nmeasurement of masses of reactants and\\\\nproducts, and carefully planned experiments\\\\nperformed by Lavoisier.\\\\nAntoine Lavoisier\\\\n(1743–1794)\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 15\\\\n\\\\n16 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nsame kind cannot combine and molecules of\\\\noxygen or hydrogen containing two atoms did\\\\nnot exist. Avogadro’s proposal was published\\\\nin the French Journal de Physique. In spite of\\\\nbeing correct, it did not gain much support.\\\\n\\\\nAfter about 50 years, in 1860, the first\\\\ninternational conference on chemistry was held\\\\nin Karlsruhe, Germany, to resolve various\\\\nideas. At the meeting, Stanislao Cannizaro\\\\npresented a sketch of a course of chemical\\\\nphilosophy, which emphasised on the\\\\nimportance of Avogadro’s work.\\\\n\\\\n1.6 Dalton’s Atomic Theory\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the origin of the idea that matter is\\\\ncomposed of small indivisible particles called ‘a-\\\\ntomio’ (meaning, indivisible ), dates back to the\\\\ntime of Democritus, a Greek\\\\nPhilosopher (460–370 BC), it\\\\nagain started emerging as a\\\\nresult of several experimental\\\\nstudies which led to the laws\\\\nmentioned above.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1808, Dalton\\\\npublished ‘A New System of\\\\nChemical Philosophy’, in\\\\nwhich he proposed the following :\\\\n\\\\nMatter consists of indivisible atoms.\\\\n\\\\nAll atoms of a given element have identical\\\\n    properties, including identical mass. Atoms\\\\n    of different elements differ in mass.\\\\n\\\\nCompounds are formed when atoms of\\\\n    different elements combine in a fixed ratio.\\\\n\\\\nChemical reactions involve reorganisation\\\\n    of atoms. These are neither created nor\\\\n    destroyed in a chemical reaction.\\\\n\\\\nDalton’s theory could explain the laws of\\\\nchemical combination. However, it could not\\\\nexplain the laws of gaseous volumes. It could\\\\nnot provide the reason for combining of\\\\natoms, which was answered later by other\\\\nscientists.\\\\n\\\\n1.7 Atomic and Molecular Masses\\\\n\\\\nAfter having some idea about the terms atoms\\\\nand molecules, it is appropriate here to\\\\nunderstand what do we mean by atomic and\\\\nmolecular masses.\\\\n1.7.1 Atomic Mass\\\\nThe atomic mass or the mass of an atom is\\\\nactually very-very small because atoms are\\\\nextremely small. Today, we have\\\\nsophisticated techniques e.g., mass\\\\nspectrometry for determining the atomic\\\\nmasses fairly accurately. But in the\\\\nnineteenth century, scientists could\\\\ndetermine the mass of one atom relative to\\\\nanother by experimental means, as has been\\\\nmentioned earlier. Hydrogen, being the\\\\nlightest atom was arbitrarily assigned a mass\\\\nof 1 (without any units) and other elements\\\\nwere assigned masses relative to it. However,\\\\nthe present system of atomic masses is based\\\\non carbon-12 as the standard and has been\\\\nagreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon-12 is one\\\\nof the isotopes of carbon and can be\\\\nrepresented as^12 C. In this system,^12 C is\\\\nassigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass\\\\nunit (amu) and masses of all other atoms are\\\\ngiven relative to this standard. One atomic\\\\nmass unit is defined as a mass exactly equal\\\\nJohn Dalton\\\\n(1776–1884)\\\\nFig. 1.9 Two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water vapour\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 17\\\\n\\\\n18 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n1.8 Mole Concept and Molar Masses\\\\n\\\\nAtoms and molecules are extremely small in\\\\nsize and their numbers in even a small amount\\\\nof any substance is really very large. To handle\\\\nsuch large numbers, a unit of convenient\\\\nmagnitude is required.\\\\n\\\\nJust as we denote one dozen for 12 items,\\\\nscore for 20 items, gross for 144 items, we\\\\nuse the idea of mole to count entities at the\\\\nmicroscopic level (i.e., atoms, molecules,\\\\nparticles, electrons, ions, etc).\\\\n\\\\nIn SI system, mole (symbol, mol) was\\\\nintroduced as seventh base quantity for the\\\\namount of a substance.\\\\n\\\\nOne mole is the amount of a substance\\\\nthat contains as many particles or entities\\\\nas there are atoms in exactly 12 g (or 0.012\\\\nkg) of the^12 C isotope. It may be emphasised\\\\nthat the mole of a substance always\\\\ncontains the same number of entities, no matter\\\\nwhat the substance may be. In order to\\\\ndetermine this number precisely, the mass of\\\\na carbon–12 atom was determined by a mass\\\\nspectrometer and found to be equal to\\\\n1.992648 × 10–23 g. Knowing that one mole of\\\\ncarbon weighs 12 g, the number of atoms in it\\\\nis equal to:\\\\n\\\\n12\\\\n1 992648 10\\\\n12\\\\n23 12\\\\ng mol C\\\\ng C atom\\\\n\\\\n. × − /\\\\n\\\\n=6 0221367 10. ×^23 atoms/mol\\\\nThis number of entities in 1 mol is so\\\\nimportant that it is given a separate name and\\\\nsymbol. It is known as ‘Avogadro constant’,\\\\nor Avogadro number denoted by NA in honour\\\\nof Amedeo Avogadro. To appreciate the\\\\nlargeness of this number, let us write it with\\\\nall zeroes without using any powers of ten.\\\\n602213670000000000000000\\\\nHence, so many entities (atoms, molecules or\\\\nany other particle) constitute one mole of a\\\\nparticular substance.\\\\nWe can, therefore, say that 1 mol of hydrogen\\\\natoms = 6.022×10^23 atoms\\\\n1 mol of water molecules = 6.022×10^23 water\\\\nmolecules\\\\n1 mol of sodium chloride = 6.022 × 10^23\\\\nformula units of sodium chloride\\\\nHaving defined the mole, it is easier to know\\\\nthe mass of one mole of a substance or the\\\\nconstituent entities. The mass of one mole\\\\nof a substance in grams is called its\\\\nmolar mass. The molar mass in grams is\\\\nnumerically equal to atomic/molecular/\\\\nformula mass in u.\\\\nMolar mass of water = 18.02 g mol-1\\\\nMolar mass of sodium chloride = 58.5 g', 'that is stored in an airtight jar at\\\\nInternational Bureau of Weights and\\\\nMeasures in Sevres, France.

This is being attempted\\\\nthrough accurate determination of\\\\nAvogadro constant. Work on this new\\\\nstandard focuses on ways to measure\\\\naccurately the number of atoms in a well-\\\\ndefined mass of sample. One such method,\\\\nwhich uses X-rays to determine the atomic\\\\ndensity of a crystal of ultrapure silicon, has\\\\nan accuracy of about 1 part in 10^6 but has\\\\nnot yet been adopted to serve as a\\\\nstandard.

He performed careful experimental\\\\nstudies for combustion reactions and reached\\\\nto the conclusion that in all physical and\\\\nchemical changes, there is no net change in\\\\nmass duting the process. Hence, he reached\\\\nto the conclusion that matter can neither be\\\\ncreated nor destroyed. This is called ‘Law of\\\\nConservation of Mass’. This law formed the\\\\nbasis for several later developments in\\\\nchemistry. Infact, this was the result of exact\\\\nmeasurement of masses of reactants and\\\\nproducts, and carefully planned experiments\\\\nperformed by Lavoisier.\\\\nAntoine Lavoisier\\\\n(1743–1794)\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 15\\\\n\\\\n16 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nsame kind cannot combine and molecules of\\\\noxygen or hydrogen containing two atoms did\\\\nnot exist. Avogadro’s proposal was published\\\\nin the French Journal de Physique. In spite of\\\\nbeing correct, it did not gain much support.\\\\n\\\\nAfter about 50 years, in 1860, the first\\\\ninternational conference on chemistry was held\\\\nin Karlsruhe, Germany, to resolve various\\\\nideas. At the meeting, Stanislao Cannizaro\\\\npresented a sketch of a course of chemical\\\\nphilosophy, which emphasised on the\\\\nimportance of Avogadro’s work.\\\\n\\\\n1.6 Dalton’s Atomic Theory\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the origin of the idea that matter is\\\\ncomposed of small indivisible particles called ‘a-\\\\ntomio’ (meaning, indivisible ), dates back to the\\\\ntime of Democritus, a Greek\\\\nPhilosopher (460–370 BC), it\\\\nagain started emerging as a\\\\nresult of several experimental\\\\nstudies which led to the laws\\\\nmentioned above.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1808, Dalton\\\\npublished ‘A New System of\\\\nChemical Philosophy’, in\\\\nwhich he proposed the following :\\\\n\\\\nMatter consists of indivisible atoms.\\\\n\\\\nAll atoms of a given element have identical\\\\n    properties, including identical mass. Atoms\\\\n    of different elements differ in mass.\\\\n\\\\nCompounds are formed when atoms of\\\\n    different elements combine in a fixed ratio.\\\\n\\\\nChemical reactions involve reorganisation\\\\n    of atoms. These are neither created nor\\\\n    destroyed in a chemical reaction.\\\\n\\\\nDalton’s theory could explain the laws of\\\\nchemical combination. However, it could not\\\\nexplain the laws of gaseous volumes. It could\\\\nnot provide the reason for combining of\\\\natoms, which was answered later by other\\\\nscientists.\\\\n\\\\n1.7 Atomic and Molecular Masses\\\\n\\\\nAfter having some idea about the terms atoms\\\\nand molecules, it is appropriate here to\\\\nunderstand what do we mean by atomic and\\\\nmolecular masses.\\\\n1.7.1 Atomic Mass\\\\nThe atomic mass or the mass of an atom is\\\\nactually very-very small because atoms are\\\\nextremely small. Today, we have\\\\nsophisticated techniques e.g., mass\\\\nspectrometry for determining the atomic\\\\nmasses fairly accurately. But in the\\\\nnineteenth century, scientists could\\\\ndetermine the mass of one atom relative to\\\\nanother by experimental means, as has been\\\\nmentioned earlier. Hydrogen, being the\\\\nlightest atom was arbitrarily assigned a mass\\\\nof 1 (without any units) and other elements\\\\nwere assigned masses relative to it. However,\\\\nthe present system of atomic masses is based\\\\non carbon-12 as the standard and has been\\\\nagreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon-12 is one\\\\nof the isotopes of carbon and can be\\\\nrepresented as^12 C. In this system,^12 C is\\\\nassigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass\\\\nunit (amu) and masses of all other atoms are\\\\ngiven relative to this standard. One atomic\\\\nmass unit is defined as a mass exactly equal\\\\nJohn Dalton\\\\n(1776–1884)\\\\nFig. 1.9 Two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water vapour\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 17\\\\n\\\\n18 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n1.8 Mole Concept and Molar Masses\\\\n\\\\nAtoms and molecules are extremely small in\\\\nsize and their numbers in even a small amount\\\\nof any substance is really very large. To handle\\\\nsuch large numbers, a unit of convenient\\\\nmagnitude is required.\\\\n\\\\nJust as we denote one dozen for 12 items,\\\\nscore for 20 items, gross for 144 items, we\\\\nuse the idea of mole to count entities at the\\\\nmicroscopic level (i.e., atoms, molecules,\\\\nparticles, electrons, ions, etc).\\\\n\\\\nIn SI system, mole (symbol, mol) was\\\\nintroduced as seventh base quantity for the\\\\namount of a substance.\\\\n\\\\nOne mole is the amount of a substance\\\\nthat contains as many particles or entities\\\\nas there are atoms in exactly 12 g (or 0.012\\\\nkg) of the^12 C isotope. It may be emphasised\\\\nthat the mole of a substance always\\\\ncontains the same number of entities, no matter\\\\nwhat the substance may be. In order to\\\\ndetermine this number precisely, the mass of\\\\na carbon–12 atom was determined by a mass\\\\nspectrometer and found to be equal to\\\\n1.992648 × 10–23 g. Knowing that one mole of\\\\ncarbon weighs 12 g, the number of atoms in it\\\\nis equal to:\\\\n\\\\n12\\\\n1 992648 10\\\\n12\\\\n23 12\\\\ng mol C\\\\ng C atom\\\\n\\\\n. × − /\\\\n\\\\n=6 0221367 10. ×^23 atoms/mol\\\\nThis number of entities in 1 mol is so\\\\nimportant that it is given a separate name and\\\\nsymbol. It is known as ‘Avogadro constant’,\\\\nor Avogadro number denoted by NA in honour\\\\nof Amedeo Avogadro. To appreciate the\\\\nlargeness of this number, let us write it with\\\\nall zeroes without using any powers of ten.\\\\n602213670000000000000000\\\\nHence, so many entities (atoms, molecules or\\\\nany other particle) constitute one mole of a\\\\nparticular substance.\\\\nWe can, therefore, say that 1 mol of hydrogen\\\\natoms = 6.022×10^23 atoms\\\\n1 mol of water molecules = 6.022×10^23 water\\\\nmolecules\\\\n1 mol of sodium chloride = 6.022 × 10^23\\\\nformula units of sodium chloride\\\\nHaving defined the mole, it is easier to know\\\\nthe mass of one mole of a substance or the\\\\nconstituent entities. The mass of one mole\\\\nof a substance in grams is called its\\\\nmolar mass. The molar mass in grams is\\\\nnumerically equal to atomic/molecular/\\\\nformula mass in u.\\\\nMolar mass of water = 18.02 g mol-1\\\\nMolar mass of sodium chloride = 58.5 g mol-1\\\\n\\\\n1.9 Percentage Composition\\\\n\\\\nSo far, we were dealing with the number of\\\\nentities present in a given sample.

Molecular formula\\\\ncan further be obtained if the molar mass is\\\\nknown. The following example illustrates this\\\\nsequence.\\\\nProblem 1.2\\\\nA compound contains 4.07% hydrogen,\\\\n24.27% carbon and 71.65% chlorine. Its\\\\nmolar mass is 98.96 g. What are its\\\\nempirical and molecular formulas?\\\\nSolution\\\\nStep 1. Conversion of mass per cent\\\\nto grams\\\\nSince we are having mass per cent, it is\\\\nconvenient to use 100 g of the compound\\\\nas the starting material. Thus, in the\\\\n100 g sample of the above compound,\\\\n4.07g hydrogen, 24.27g carbon and\\\\n71.65g chlorine are present.\\\\nStep 2. Convert into number moles of\\\\neach element\\\\nDivide the masses obtained above by\\\\nrespective atomic masses of various\\\\nelements.

Divide each of the mole values\\\\nobtained above by the smallest number\\\\namongst them\\\\nSince 2.021 is smallest value, division by\\\\nit gives a ratio of 2:1:1 for H:C:Cl.\\\\nIn case the ratios are not whole numbers, then\\\\nthey may be converted into whole number by\\\\nmultiplying by the suitable coefficient.\\\\nStep 4. Write down the empirical formula\\\\nby mentioning the numbers after writing\\\\nthe symbols of respective elements\\\\nCH 2 Cl is, thus, the empirical formula of\\\\nthe above compound.\\\\nStep 5. Writing molecular formula\\\\n(a) Determine empirical formula mass by\\\\nadding the atomic masses of various\\\\natoms present in the empirical formula.\\\\nFor CH 2 Cl, empirical formula mass is\\\\n12.01 + (2 × 1.008) + 35.453\\\\n= 49.48 g\\\\n(b) Divide Molar mass by empirical\\\\nformula mass\\\\n= 2 = ( n )\\\\n(c) Multiply empirical formula by n\\\\nobtained above to get the molecular\\\\nformula\\\\nEmpirical formula = CH 2 Cl, n = 2. Hence\\\\nmolecular formula is C 2 H 4 Cl 2.\\\\navailable from the balanced chemical equation\\\\nof a given reaction. Let us consider the\\\\ncombustion of methane. A balanced equation\\\\nfor this reaction is as given below:\\\\nCH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + 2 H 2 O (g)\\\\nHere, methane and dioxygen are called\\\\nreactants and carbon dioxide and water are\\\\ncalled products. Note that all the reactants and\\\\nthe products are gases in the above reaction\\\\nand this has been indicated by letter (g) in the\\\\nbrackets next to its formula. Similarly, in case\\\\nof solids and liquids, (s) and (l) are written\\\\nrespectively.\\\\nThe coefficients 2 for O 2 and H 2 O are called\\\\nstoichiometric coefficients. Similarly the\\\\ncoefficient for CH 4 and CO 2 is one in each case.\\\\nThey represent the number of molecules (and\\\\nmoles as well) taking part in the reaction or\\\\nformed in the reaction.\\\\nThus, according to the above chemical\\\\nreaction,\\\\n- One mole of CH 4 (g) reacts with two moles\\\\n    of O 2 (g) to give one mole of CO 2 (g) and\\\\n    two moles of H 2 O(g)\\\\n- One molecule of CH 4 (g) reacts with\\\\n    2 molecules of O 2 (g) to give one molecule\\\\n    of CO 2 (g) and 2 molecules of H 2 O(g)\\\\n- 22.7 L of CH 4 (g) reacts with 45.4 L of O 2 (g)\\\\n    to give 22.7 L of CO 2 (g) and 45.4 L of H 2 O(g)\\\\n- 16 g of CH 4 (g) reacts with 2×32 g of O 2 (g) to\\\\n    give 44 g of CO 2 (g) and 2×18 g of H 2 O (g).\\\\nFrom these relationships, the given data can\\\\nbe interconverted as follows:\\\\n\\\\nMass\\\\nVolume\\\\n=Density\\\\n1.10.1Limiting Reagent\\\\nMany a time, reactions are carried out with the\\\\namounts of reactants that are different than\\\\nthe amounts as required by a balanced\\\\nchemical reaction.

The\\\\nreactant which is present in the least amount\\\\n\\\\n1.10Stoichiometry and Stoichiometric Calculations\\\\n\\\\nThe word ‘stoichiometry’ is derived from two\\\\nGreek words — stoicheion (meaning, element )\\\\nand metron (meaning, measure ).\\\\nStoichiometry, thus, deals with the calculation\\\\nof masses (sometimes volumes also) of the\\\\nreactants and the products involved in a\\\\nchemical reaction. Before understanding how\\\\nto calculate the amounts of reactants required\\\\nor the products produced in a chemical\\\\nreaction, let us study what information is\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 21\\\\n\\\\ngets consumed after sometime and after that\\\\nfurther reaction does not take place whatever\\\\nbe the amount of the other reactant. Hence,\\\\nthe reactant, which gets consumed first, limits\\\\nthe amount of product formed and is, therefore,\\\\ncalled the limiting reagent.\\\\nIn performing stoichiometric calculations,\\\\nthis aspect is also to be kept in mind.\\\\n1.10.2 Reactions in Solutions\\\\nA majority of reactions in the laboratories are\\\\ncarried out in solutions. Therefore, it is\\\\nimportant to understand as how the amount\\\\nof substance is expressed when it is present in\\\\nthe solution. The concentration of a solution\\\\nor the amount of substance present in its\\\\ngiven volume can be expressed in any of the\\\\nfollowing ways.\\\\n1. Mass per cent or weight per cent (w/w %)\\\\n2. Mole fraction\\\\n3. Molarity\\\\n4. Molality\\\\n    Let us now study each one of them in detail.\\\\n\\\\nBalancing a chemical equation\\\\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same\\\\nnumber of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can\\\\nbe balanced by trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with\\\\noxygen to give oxides\\\\n4 Fe(s) + 3O 2 (g) → 2Fe 2 O 3 (s) (a) balanced equation\\\\n2 Mg(s) + O 2 (g) → 2MgO(s) (b) balanced equation\\\\nP 4 (s) + O 2 (g) → P 4 O 10 (s) (c) unbalanced equation\\\\nEquations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on\\\\neach side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus\\\\natoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on\\\\nthe left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the\\\\nright side of the equation.\\\\nP 4 (s) + 5O 2 (g) → P 4 O 10 (s) balanced equation\\\\nNow, let us take combustion of propane, C 3 H 8. This equation can be balanced in steps.\\\\nStep 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen\\\\nare reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) + O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + H 2 O(l) unbalanced equation\\\\nStep 2 Balance the number of C atoms: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore,\\\\nthree CO 2 molecules are required on the right side.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) + O 2 (g) → 3CO 2 (g) + H 2 O (l)\\\\nStep 3 Balance the number of H atoms : on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants\\\\nhowever, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be\\\\nrequired for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) +O 2 (g) → 3CO 2 (g)+4H 2 O (l)\\\\nStep 4 Balance the number of O atoms : There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in\\\\nCO 2 and 4 × 1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O 2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10\\\\nCO 2 and 4 × 1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O 2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10\\\\noxygen atoms.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) +5O 2 (g) → 3CO 2 (g) + 4H 2 O (l)\\\\nStep 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The\\\\nequation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.\\\\nAll equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always\\\\nremember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance\\\\nan equation.\\\\n\\\\n22 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nProblem 1.3\\\\nCalculate the amount of water (g)\\\\nproduced by the combustion of 16 g\\\\nof methane.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe balanced equation for the combustion\\\\nof methane is :\\\\nCH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + 2H 2 O (g)\\\\n(i)16 g of CH 4 corresponds to one mole.\\\\n(ii) From the above equation, 1 mol of\\\\nCH 4 (g) gives 2 mol of H 2 O (g).\\\\n2 mol of water (H 2 O) = 2 × (2+16)\\\\n= 2 × 18 = 36 g\\\\n1 mol H 2 O = 18 g H 2 O ⇒\\\\n18 g H O\\\\n1mol H O\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n= 1\\\\n\\\\nHence, 2 mol H 2 O ×\\\\n18 g H O\\\\n1mol H O\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n= 2 × 18 g H 2 O = 36 g H 2 O\\\\nProblem 1.4\\\\nHow many moles of methane are required\\\\nto produce 22g CO 2 (g) after combustion?\\\\nSolution\\\\nAccording to the chemical equation,\\\\nCH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + 2H 2 O (g)\\\\n44g CO 2 (g) is obtained from 16 g CH 4 (g).\\\\n[∴1 mol CO 2 (g) is obtained from 1 mol of\\\\nCH 4 (g)]\\\\nNumber of moles of CO 2 (g)\\\\n= 22 g CO 2 (g) ×\\\\n\\\\n44\\\\n\\\\n1000\\\\n\\\\n(^2) 28 0\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nkg N\\\\ng N\\\\nkg N\\\\nmol N\\\\ng N\\\\n\\\\n× ×\\\\n\\\\n= 17.86×10^2 mol\\\\nNumber of moles of H 2\\\\n\\\\n= 10 00\\\\n\\\\n1000\\\\n\\\\n(^2) 2 016\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nkg H\\\\ng H\\\\nkg H\\\\nmol H\\\\ng H\\\\n\\\\n× ×\\\\n\\\\n= 4.96×10^3 mol\\\\nAccording to the above equation, 1 mol\\\\nN 2 (g) requires 3 mol H 2 (g), for the reaction.\\\\nHence, for 17.86×10^2 mol of N 2 , the moles\\\\nof H 2 (g) required would be\\\\n\\\\n17 86 10\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n. × ×\\\\n\\\\n( )\\\\n( )\\\\nmol N\\\\nmol H g\\\\nmol N g\\\\n= 5.36 ×10^3 mol H 2\\\\nBut we have only 4.96×10^3 mol H 2.

For 0.2 M solution,\\\\nwe require 0.2 moles of NaOH dissolved in\\\\n1 litre solution.\\\\nHence, for making 0.2M solution from 1M\\\\nsolution, we have to take that volume of 1M NaOH\\\\nsolution, which contains 0.2 mol of NaOH and\\\\ndilute the solution with water to 1 litre.\\\\nNow, how much volume of concentrated\\\\n(1M) NaOH solution be taken, which contains\\\\n0.2 moles of NaOH can be calculated as follows:\\\\nIf 1 mol is present in 1L or 1000 mL\\\\nsolution\\\\nthen, 0.2 mol is present in\\\\n1000\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n0 2\\\\n\\\\nmL\\\\nmol\\\\n×. mol solution\\\\n= 200 mL solution\\\\nThus, 200 mL of 1M NaOH are taken and\\\\nenough water is added to dilute it to make it 1 litre.\\\\nIn fact for such calculations, a general\\\\nformula, M 1 × V 1 = M 2 × V 2 where M and V are\\\\nmolarity and volume, respectively, can be used.\\\\nIn this case, M 1 is equal to 0.2M; V 1 = 1000 mL\\\\nand, M 2 = 1.0M; V 2 is to be calculated.\\\\nSubstituting the values in the formula:\\\\n0.2 M × 1000 mL = 1.0 M × V 2\\\\nNote that the number of moles of solute\\\\n(NaOH) was 0.2 in 200 mL and it has remained\\\\nthe same , i.e., 0.2 even after dilution ( in 1000\\\\nmL) as we have changed just the amount of\\\\nsolvent (i.e., water) and have not done anything\\\\nwith respect to NaOH.

Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes\\\\nundergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states\\\\n- solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these\\\\nstates of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties.

Molecular formula\\\\ncan further be obtained if the molar mass is\\\\nknown. The following example illustrates this\\\\nsequence.\\\\nProblem 1.2\\\\nA compound contains 4.07% hydrogen,\\\\n24.27% carbon and 71.65% chlorine. Its\\\\nmolar mass is 98.96 g. What are its\\\\nempirical and molecular formulas?\\\\nSolution\\\\nStep 1. Conversion of mass per cent\\\\nto grams\\\\nSince we are having mass per cent, it is\\\\nconvenient to use 100 g of the compound\\\\nas the starting material.

A balanced equation\\\\nfor this reaction is as given below:\\\\nCH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + 2 H 2 O (g)\\\\nHere, methane and dioxygen are called\\\\nreactants and carbon dioxide and water are\\\\ncalled products. Note that all the reactants and\\\\nthe products are gases in the above reaction\\\\nand this has been indicated by letter (g) in the\\\\nbrackets next to its formula. Similarly, in case\\\\nof solids and liquids, (s) and (l) are written\\\\nrespectively.\\\\nThe coefficients 2 for O 2 and H 2 O are called\\\\nstoichiometric coefficients. Similarly the\\\\ncoefficient for CH 4 and CO 2 is one in each case.\\\\nThey represent the number of molecules (and\\\\nmoles as well) taking part in the reaction or\\\\nformed in the reaction.\\\\nThus, according to the above chemical\\\\nreaction,\\\\n- One mole of CH 4 (g) reacts with two moles\\\\n    of O 2 (g) to give one mole of CO 2 (g) and\\\\n    two moles of H 2 O(g)\\\\n- One molecule of CH 4 (g) reacts with\\\\n    2 molecules of O 2 (g) to give one molecule\\\\n    of CO 2 (g) and 2 molecules of H 2 O(g)\\\\n- 22.7 L of CH 4 (g) reacts with 45.4 L of O 2 (g)\\\\n    to give 22.7 L of CO 2 (g) and 45.4 L of H 2 O(g)\\\\n- 16 g of CH 4 (g) reacts with 2×32 g of O 2 (g) to\\\\n    give 44 g of CO 2 (g) and 2×18 g of H 2 O (g).\\\\nFrom these relationships, the given data can\\\\nbe interconverted as follows:\\\\n\\\\nMass\\\\nVolume\\\\n=Density\\\\n1.10.1Limiting Reagent\\\\nMany a time, reactions are carried out with the\\\\namounts of reactants that are different than\\\\nthe amounts as required by a balanced\\\\nchemical reaction.

Before understanding how\\\\nto calculate the amounts of reactants required\\\\nor the products produced in a chemical\\\\nreaction, let us study what information is\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 21\\\\n\\\\ngets consumed after sometime and after that\\\\nfurther reaction does not take place whatever\\\\nbe the amount of the other reactant. Hence,\\\\nthe reactant, which gets consumed first, limits\\\\nthe amount of product formed and is, therefore,\\\\ncalled the limiting reagent.\\\\nIn performing stoichiometric calculations,\\\\nthis aspect is also to be kept in mind.\\\\n1.10.2 Reactions in Solutions\\\\nA majority of reactions in the laboratories are\\\\ncarried out in solutions. Therefore, it is\\\\nimportant to understand as how the amount\\\\nof substance is expressed when it is present in\\\\nthe solution. The concentration of a solution\\\\nor the amount of substance present in its\\\\ngiven volume can be expressed in any of the\\\\nfollowing ways.\\\\n1. Mass per cent or weight per cent (w/w %)\\\\n2. Mole fraction\\\\n3. Molarity\\\\n4. Molality\\\\n    Let us now study each one of them in detail.\\\\n\\\\nBalancing a chemical equation\\\\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same\\\\nnumber of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can\\\\nbe balanced by trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with\\\\noxygen to give oxides\\\\n4 Fe(s) + 3O 2 (g) → 2Fe 2 O 3 (s) (a) balanced equation\\\\n2 Mg(s) + O 2 (g) → 2MgO(s) (b) balanced equation\\\\nP 4 (s) + O 2 (g) → P 4 O 10 (s) (c) unbalanced equation\\\\nEquations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on\\\\neach side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus\\\\natoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on\\\\nthe left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the\\\\nright side of the equation.\\\\nP 4 (s) + 5O 2 (g) → P 4 O 10 (s) balanced equation\\\\nNow, let us take combustion of propane, C 3 H 8. This equation can be balanced in steps.\\\\nStep 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen\\\\nare reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) + O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + H 2 O(l) unbalanced equation\\\\nStep 2 Balance the number of C atoms: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore,\\\\nthree CO 2 molecules are required on the right side.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) + O 2 (g) → 3CO 2 (g) + H 2 O (l)\\\\nStep 3 Balance the number of H atoms : on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants\\\\nhowever, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be\\\\nrequired for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) +O 2 (g) → 3CO 2 (g)+4H 2 O (l)\\\\nStep 4 Balance the number of O atoms : There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in\\\\nCO 2 and 4 × 1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O 2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10\\\\nCO 2 and 4 × 1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O 2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10\\\\noxygen atoms.\\\\nC 3 H 8 (g) +5O 2 (g) → 3CO 2 (g) + 4H 2 O (l)\\\\nStep 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The\\\\nequation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.\\\\nAll equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always\\\\nremember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance\\\\nan equation.\\\\n\\\\n22 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nProblem 1.3\\\\nCalculate the amount of water (g)\\\\nproduced by the combustion of 16 g\\\\nof methane.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe balanced equation for the combustion\\\\nof methane is :\\\\nCH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + 2H 2 O (g)\\\\n(i)16 g of CH 4 corresponds to one mole.\\\\n(ii) From the above equation, 1 mol of\\\\nCH 4 (g) gives 2 mol of H 2 O (g).\\\\n2 mol of water (H 2 O) = 2 × (2+16)\\\\n= 2 × 18 = 36 g\\\\n1 mol H 2 O = 18 g H 2 O ⇒\\\\n18 g H O\\\\n1mol H O\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n= 1\\\\n\\\\nHence, 2 mol H 2 O ×\\\\n18 g H O\\\\n1mol H O\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n= 2 × 18 g H 2 O = 36 g H 2 O\\\\nProblem 1.4\\\\nHow many moles of methane are required\\\\nto produce 22g CO 2 (g) after combustion?\\\\nSolution\\\\nAccording to the chemical equation,\\\\nCH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g) + 2H 2 O (g)\\\\n44g CO 2 (g) is obtained from 16 g CH 4 (g).\\\\n[∴1 mol CO 2 (g) is obtained from 1 mol of\\\\nCH 4 (g)]\\\\nNumber of moles of CO 2 (g)\\\\n= 22 g CO 2 (g) ×\\\\n\\\\n44\\\\n\\\\n1000\\\\n\\\\n(^2) 28 0\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nkg N\\\\ng N\\\\nkg N\\\\nmol N\\\\ng N\\\\n\\\\n× ×\\\\n\\\\n= 17.86×10^2 mol\\\\nNumber of moles of H 2\\\\n\\\\n= 10 00\\\\n\\\\n1000\\\\n\\\\n(^2) 2 016\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nkg H\\\\ng H\\\\nkg H\\\\nmol H\\\\ng H\\\\n\\\\n× ×\\\\n\\\\n= 4.96×10^3 mol\\\\nAccording to the above equation, 1 mol\\\\nN 2 (g) requires 3 mol H 2 (g), for the reaction.\\\\nHence, for 17.86×10^2 mol of N 2 , the moles\\\\nof H 2 (g) required would be\\\\n\\\\n17 86 10\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n. × ×\\\\n\\\\n( )\\\\n( )\\\\nmol N\\\\nmol H g\\\\nmol N g\\\\n= 5.36 ×10^3 mol H 2\\\\nBut we have only 4.96×10^3 mol H 2.

Molarity\\\\nIt is the most widely used unit and is denoted\\\\nby M. It is defined as the number of moles of\\\\nthe solute in 1 litre of the solution. Thus,\\\\n\\\\nMolarity (M) =\\\\nNo. of moles of solute\\\\nVolume of solution in litres\\\\nSuppose, we have 1 M solution of a\\\\nsubstance, say NaOH, and we want to prepare\\\\na 0.2 M solution from it.\\\\n1 M NaOH means 1 mol of NaOH present\\\\nin 1 litre of the solution. For 0.2 M solution,\\\\nwe require 0.2 moles of NaOH dissolved in\\\\n1 litre solution.\\\\nHence, for making 0.2M solution from 1M\\\\nsolution, we have to take that volume of 1M NaOH\\\\nsolution, which contains 0.2 mol of NaOH and\\\\ndilute the solution with water to 1 litre.\\\\nNow, how much volume of concentrated\\\\n(1M) NaOH solution be taken, which contains\\\\n0.2 moles of NaOH can be calculated as follows:\\\\nIf 1 mol is present in 1L or 1000 mL\\\\nsolution\\\\nthen, 0.2 mol is present in\\\\n1000\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n0 2\\\\n\\\\nmL\\\\nmol\\\\n×. mol solution\\\\n= 200 mL solution\\\\nThus, 200 mL of 1M NaOH are taken and\\\\nenough water is added to dilute it to make it 1 litre.\\\\nIn fact for such calculations, a general\\\\nformula, M 1 × V 1 = M 2 × V 2 where M and V are\\\\nmolarity and volume, respectively, can be used.\\\\nIn this case, M 1 is equal to 0.2M; V 1 = 1000 mL\\\\nand, M 2 = 1.0M; V 2 is to be calculated.\\\\nSubstituting the values in the formula:\\\\n0.2 M × 1000 mL = 1.0 M × V 2\\\\nNote that the number of moles of solute\\\\n(NaOH) was 0.2 in 200 mL and it has remained\\\\nthe same , i.e., 0.2 even after dilution ( in 1000\\\\nmL) as we have changed just the amount of\\\\nsolvent (i.e., water) and have not done anything\\\\nwith respect to NaOH. But keep in mind the\\\\nconcentration.\\\\n1.

People in ancient\\\\nIndia, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the\\\\nadvent of modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life.\\\\nThe study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere\\\\nof life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes\\\\nundergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states\\\\n- solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these\\\\nstates of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be\\\\nclassified into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of\\\\nonly one type, which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where\\\\natoms of two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur\\\\nwidely and many of the substances present around us are mixtures.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The\\\\nquantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which\\\\nthe quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which\\\\nProblem 1.8\\\\nThe density of 3 M solution of NaCl is\\\\n1.25 g mL–1.

Note that the molality of a solution\\\\ndoes not change with temperature since\\\\nmass remains unaffected with temperature.\\\\n4. Molality\\\\n\\\\nIt is defined as the number of moles of solute\\\\npresent in 1 kg of solvent. It is denoted by m.\\\\n\\\\nThus, Molality (m) =\\\\n\\\\nNo. of moles of solute\\\\nMass of solvent in kg\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 25\\\\n\\\\nthe English and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however,\\\\nhas agreed to have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is\\\\nabbreviated as SI units (International System of Units).\\\\nSince measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a\\\\ncertain amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the\\\\nquantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread\\\\nover a wide range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers\\\\nin scientific notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number\\\\nof significant figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis\\\\nhelps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible\\\\nto interconvert the results from one system of units to another.\\\\nThe combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination\\\\n— these being the Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of\\\\nMultiple Proportions, Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes and Avogadro Law. All\\\\nthese laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building\\\\nblocks of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to^12 C isotope of\\\\ncarbon, which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is\\\\nthe average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of\\\\ndifferent isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by\\\\ntaking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular\\\\nformula can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present\\\\nin a compound and its molecular mass.\\\\nThe number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are\\\\nexpressed in the terms of Avogadro constant (6.022 × 10^23 ). This is known as 1 mol of\\\\nthe respective particles or entities.\\\\nChemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements\\\\nand compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The\\\\ncoefficients indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part\\\\nin a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products\\\\nformed is called stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or\\\\nmore reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined\\\\nand vice-versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is\\\\nexpressed in number of ways, e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n1.1 Calculate the molar mass of the following:\\\\n(i) H 2 O (ii) CO 2 (iii) CH 4\\\\n1.2 Calculate the mass per cent of different elements present in sodium sulphate\\\\n(Na 2 SO 4 ).\\\\n1.3 Determine the empirical formula of an oxide of iron, which has 69.9% iron and\\\\n30.1% dioxygen by mass.\\\\n1.4 Calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that could be produced when\\\\n(i) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in air.\\\\n(ii) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\\\\n(iii) 2 moles of carbon are burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\\\\n1.5 Calculate the mass of sodium acetate (CH 3 COONa) required to make 500 mL of\\\\n0.375 molar aqueous solution.

Dalton’s atomic theory was able to explain\\\\nthe law of conservation of mass, law of constant\\\\ncomposition and law of multiple proportion very\\\\nsuccessfully. However, it failed to explain the results of\\\\nmany experiments, for example, it was known that\\\\nsubstances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk\\\\nor fur get electrically charged.\\\\nIn this unit we start with the experimental\\\\nobservations made by scientists towards the end of\\\\nnineteenth and beginning of twentieth century. These\\\\nestablished that atoms are made of sub-atomic particles,\\\\ni.e., electrons, protons and neutrons — a concept very\\\\ndifferent from that of Dalton.\\\\n\\\\nObjectives\\\\n\\\\n30 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n2.1 Discovery of Sub-atomic Particles\\\\n\\\\nAn insight into the structure of atom was\\\\nobtained from the experiments on electrical\\\\ndischarge through gases. Before we discuss\\\\nthese results we need to keep in mind a basic\\\\nrule regarding the behaviour of charged\\\\nparticles : “Like charges repel each other and\\\\nunlike charges attract each other”.\\\\n\\\\n2.1.1 Discovery of Electron\\\\n\\\\nIn 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if\\\\nelectricity is passed through a solution of an\\\\nelectrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at\\\\nthe electrodes, which resulted in the\\\\nliberation and deposition of matter at the\\\\nelectrodes. He formulated certain laws which\\\\nyou will study in class XII. These results\\\\nsuggested the particulate nature of\\\\nelectricity.\\\\nIn mid 1850s many scientists mainly\\\\nFaraday began to study electrical discharge\\\\nin partially evacuated tubes, known as\\\\ncathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted\\\\nin Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of\\\\nglass containing two thin pieces of metal,\\\\ncalled electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical\\\\ndischarge through the gases could be\\\\nobserved only at very low pressures and at\\\\nvery high voltages. The pressure of different\\\\ngases could be adjusted by evacuation of the\\\\nglass tubes. When sufficiently high voltage\\\\nis applied across the electrodes, current\\\\nstarts flowing through a stream of particles\\\\nmoving in the tube from the negative electrode\\\\n(cathode) to the positive electrode (anode).\\\\nThese were called cathode rays or cathode\\\\nray particles. The flow of current from\\\\ncathode to anode was further checked by\\\\nmaking a hole in the anode and coating the\\\\ntube behind anode with phosphorescent\\\\nmaterial zinc sulphide. When these rays, after\\\\npassing through anode, strike the zinc\\\\nsulphide coating, a bright spot is developed\\\\non the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)].\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube\\\\nFig. 2.1(b) A cathode ray discharge tube with\\\\nperforated anode\\\\nThe results of these experiments are\\\\nsummarised below.\\\\n(i) The cathode rays start from cathode and\\\\nmove towards the anode.\\\\n(ii) These rays themselves are not visible but\\\\ntheir behaviour can be observed with the\\\\nhelp of certain kind of materials\\\\n(fluorescent or phosphorescent) which\\\\nglow when hit by them. Television picture\\\\ntubes are cathode ray tubes and\\\\ntelevision pictures result due to\\\\nfluorescence on the television screen\\\\ncoated with certain fluorescent or\\\\nphosphorescent materials.\\\\n(iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic\\\\nfield, these rays travel in straight lines\\\\n(Fig. 2.2).\\\\n(iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic\\\\nfield, the behaviour of cathode rays are\\\\nsimilar to that expected from negatively\\\\ncharged particles, suggesting that the\\\\ncathode rays consist of negatively\\\\ncharged particles, called electrons.\\\\n(v) The characteristics of cathode rays\\\\n(electrons) do not depend upon the\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 31\\\\n\\\\nmaterial of electrodes and the nature of\\\\nthe gas present in the cathode ray tube.\\\\nThus, we can conclude that electrons are\\\\nbasic constituent of all the atoms.\\\\n2.1.2 Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron\\\\n\\\\nIn 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson\\\\nmeasured the ratio of electrical charge ( e ) to\\\\nthe mass of electron ( m e ) by using cathode ray\\\\ntube and applying electrical and magnetic field\\\\nperpendicular to each other as well as to the\\\\npath of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only electric\\\\nfield is applied, the electrons deviate from their\\\\npath and hit the cathode ray tube at point A\\\\n(Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only magnetic field\\\\nis applied, electron strikes the cathode ray tube\\\\nat point C. By carefully balancing the electrical\\\\nand magnetic field strength, it is possible to\\\\nbring back the electron to the path which is\\\\nfollowed in the absence of electric or magnetic\\\\nfield and they hit the screen at point B.\\\\nThomson argued that the amount of deviation\\\\nof the particles from their path in the presence\\\\nof electrical or magnetic field depends upon:\\\\n\\\\n(i) the magnitude of the negative charge on\\\\nthe particle, greater the magnitude of the\\\\ncharge on the particle, greater is the\\\\ninteraction with the electric or magnetic\\\\nfield and thus greater is the deflection.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the\\\\nparticle, greater the deflection.\\\\n\\\\n1.6 × 10–19 C. The present accepted value of\\\\nelectrical charge is – 1.602176 × 10–19 C. The\\\\nmass of the electron ( m e) was determined by\\\\ncombining these results with Thomson’s value\\\\nof e / m e ratio.\\\\n\\\\n= 9.1094×10–31 kg (2.2)\\\\nFig. 2.2 The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electron\\\\n\\\\n32 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and Neutrons\\\\n\\\\nElectrical discharge carried out in the modified\\\\ncathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal\\\\nrays carrying positively charged particles. The\\\\ncharacteristics of these positively charged\\\\nparticles are listed below.\\\\n(i) Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively\\\\ncharged particles depends upon the\\\\nnature of gas present in the cathode ray\\\\ntube. These are simply the positively\\\\ncharged gaseous ions.\\\\n(ii) The charge to mass ratio of the particles\\\\ndepends on the gas from which these\\\\noriginate.\\\\n(iii) Some of the positively charged particles\\\\ncarry a multiple of the fundamental unit\\\\nof electrical charge.\\\\n(iv) The behaviour of these particles in the\\\\nmagnetic or electrical field is opposite to\\\\nthat observed for electron or cathode\\\\nrays.\\\\nThe smallest and lightest positive', 'solute\\\\nMass of solvent in kg\\\\n\\\\n3 mol\\\\n1 0745. kg = 2.79 m\\\\nOften in a chemistry laboratory, a solution\\\\nof a desired concentration is prepared by\\\\ndiluting a solution of known higher\\\\nconcentration. The solution of higher\\\\nconcentration is also known as stock\\\\nsolution. Note that the molality of a solution\\\\ndoes not change with temperature since\\\\nmass remains unaffected with temperature.\\\\n4. Molality\\\\n\\\\nIt is defined as the number of moles of solute\\\\npresent in 1 kg of solvent. It is denoted by m.\\\\n\\\\nThus, Molality (m) =\\\\n\\\\nNo. of moles of solute\\\\nMass of solvent in kg\\\\n\\\\nSOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY 25\\\\n\\\\nthe English and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however,\\\\nhas agreed to have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is\\\\nabbreviated as SI units (International System of Units).\\\\nSince measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a\\\\ncertain amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the\\\\nquantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread\\\\nover a wide range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers\\\\nin scientific notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number\\\\nof significant figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis\\\\nhelps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible\\\\nto interconvert the results from one system of units to another.\\\\nThe combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination\\\\n— these being the Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of\\\\nMultiple Proportions, Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes and Avogadro Law. All\\\\nthese laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building\\\\nblocks of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to^12 C isotope of\\\\ncarbon, which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is\\\\nthe average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of\\\\ndifferent isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by\\\\ntaking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular\\\\nformula can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present\\\\nin a compound and its molecular mass.\\\\nThe number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are\\\\nexpressed in the terms of Avogadro constant (6.022 × 10^23 ). This is known as 1 mol of\\\\nthe respective particles or entities.\\\\nChemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements\\\\nand compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The\\\\ncoefficients indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part\\\\nin a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products\\\\nformed is called stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or\\\\nmore reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined\\\\nand vice-versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is\\\\nexpressed in number of ways, e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n1.1 Calculate the molar mass of the following:\\\\n(i) H 2 O (ii) CO 2 (iii) CH 4\\\\n1.2 Calculate the mass per cent of different elements present in sodium sulphate\\\\n(Na 2 SO 4 ).\\\\n1.3 Determine the empirical formula of an oxide of iron, which has 69.9% iron and\\\\n30.1% dioxygen by mass.\\\\n1.4 Calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that could be produced when\\\\n(i) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in air.\\\\n(ii) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\\\\n(iii) 2 moles of carbon are burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\\\\n1.5 Calculate the mass of sodium acetate (CH 3 COONa) required to make 500 mL of\\\\n0.375 molar aqueous solution.

Television picture\\\\ntubes are cathode ray tubes and\\\\ntelevision pictures result due to\\\\nfluorescence on the television screen\\\\ncoated with certain fluorescent or\\\\nphosphorescent materials.\\\\n(iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic\\\\nfield, these rays travel in straight lines\\\\n(Fig. 2.2).\\\\n(iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic\\\\nfield, the behaviour of cathode rays are\\\\nsimilar to that expected from negatively\\\\ncharged particles, suggesting that the\\\\ncathode rays consist of negatively\\\\ncharged particles, called electrons.\\\\n(v) The characteristics of cathode rays\\\\n(electrons) do not depend upon the\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 31\\\\n\\\\nmaterial of electrodes and the nature of\\\\nthe gas present in the cathode ray tube.\\\\nThus, we can conclude that electrons are\\\\nbasic constituent of all the atoms.\\\\n2.1.2 Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron\\\\n\\\\nIn 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson\\\\nmeasured the ratio of electrical charge ( e ) to\\\\nthe mass of electron ( m e ) by using cathode ray\\\\ntube and applying electrical and magnetic field\\\\nperpendicular to each other as well as to the\\\\npath of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only electric\\\\nfield is applied, the electrons deviate from their\\\\npath and hit the cathode ray tube at point A\\\\n(Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only magnetic field\\\\nis applied, electron strikes the cathode ray tube\\\\nat point C. By carefully balancing the electrical\\\\nand magnetic field strength, it is possible to\\\\nbring back the electron to the path which is\\\\nfollowed in the absence of electric or magnetic\\\\nfield and they hit the screen at point B.\\\\nThomson argued that the amount of deviation\\\\nof the particles from their path in the presence\\\\nof electrical or magnetic field depends upon:\\\\n\\\\n(i) the magnitude of the negative charge on\\\\nthe particle, greater the magnitude of the\\\\ncharge on the particle, greater is the\\\\ninteraction with the electric or magnetic\\\\nfield and thus greater is the deflection.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the\\\\nparticle, greater the deflection.\\\\n\\\\n1.6 × 10–19 C. The present accepted value of\\\\nelectrical charge is – 1.602176 × 10–19 C. The\\\\nmass of the electron ( m e) was determined by\\\\ncombining these results with Thomson’s value\\\\nof e / m e ratio.\\\\n\\\\n= 9.1094×10–31 kg (2.2)\\\\nFig. 2.2 The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electron\\\\n\\\\n32 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and Neutrons\\\\n\\\\nElectrical discharge carried out in the modified\\\\ncathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal\\\\nrays carrying positively charged particles.

This positively charged particle was\\\\ncharacterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt\\\\nfor the presence of electrically neutral particle\\\\nas one of the constituent of atom. These\\\\nparticles were discovered by Chadwick (1932)\\\\nby bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by\\\\nα-particles.

Thomson and the other proposed by\\\\nErnest Rutherford are discussed below.\\\\n\\\\n2.2.1 Thomson Model of Atom\\\\n\\\\nJ. J. Thomson, in 1898, proposed that an atom\\\\npossesses a spherical shape (radius\\\\napproximately 10–10 m) in which the positive\\\\ncharge is uniformly distributed. The electrons\\\\nare embedded into it in such a manner as to\\\\ngive the most stable electrostatic arrangement\\\\n(Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given to\\\\nthis model, for example, plum pudding, raisin\\\\npudding or watermelon. This model can be\\\\n\\\\nIn the later half of the nineteenth century\\\\ndifferent kinds of rays were discovered,\\\\nbesides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm\\\\nRöentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed\\\\nthat when electrons strike a material in\\\\nthe cathode ray tubes, produce rays\\\\nwhich can cause fluorescence in the\\\\nfluorescent materials placed outside the\\\\ncathode ray tubes. Since Röentgen did not\\\\nknow the nature of the radiation, he\\\\nnamed them X-rays and the name is still\\\\ncarried on. It was noticed that X-rays are\\\\nproduced effectively when electrons strike\\\\nthe dense metal anode, called targets.\\\\nThese are not deflected by the electric and\\\\nmagnetic fields and have a very high\\\\npenetrating power through the matter\\\\nand that is the reason that these rays are\\\\nused to study the interior of the objects.\\\\nThese rays are of very short wavelengths\\\\n(∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic\\\\ncharacter (Section 2.3.1).\\\\nHenri Becqueral (1852-1908)\\\\nobserved that there are certain elements\\\\nwhich emit radiation on their own and\\\\nnamed this phenomenon as\\\\nradioactivity and the elements known\\\\nas radioactive elements.

He\\\\nconcluded that α- particles are helium\\\\nFig.2.4 Thomson model of atom\\\\nvisualised as a pudding or watermelon of\\\\npositive charge with plums or seeds (electrons)\\\\nembedded into it.

Rutherford’s famous\\\\nααααα–particle scattering experiment is\\\\n\\\\nrepresented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high energy\\\\nα–particles from a radioactive source was\\\\ndirected at a thin foil (thickness ∼ 100 nm) of\\\\ngold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular\\\\nfluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it.\\\\nWhenever α–particles struck the screen, a tiny\\\\nflash of light was produced at that point.\\\\nThe results of scattering experiment were\\\\nquite unexpected. According to Thomson\\\\nmodel of atom, the mass of each gold atom in\\\\nthe foil should have been spread evenly over\\\\nthe entire atom, and α– particles had enough\\\\nenergy to pass directly through such a uniform\\\\ndistribution of mass. It was expected that the\\\\nparticles would slow down and change\\\\ndirections only by a small angles as they passed\\\\nthrough the foil. It was observed that:\\\\n(i) most of the α–particles passed through\\\\nthe gold foil undeflected.\\\\n(ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was\\\\ndeflected by small angles.\\\\n(iii) a very few α–particles (∼1 in 20,000)\\\\nbounced back, that is, were deflected by\\\\nnearly 180°.\\\\nOn the basis of the observations,\\\\nRutherford drew the following conclusions\\\\nregarding the structure of atom:\\\\n(i) Most of the space in the atom is empty as\\\\nmost of the α–particles passed through\\\\nthe foil undeflected.\\\\n(ii) A few positively charged α–particles were\\\\ndeflected. The deflection must be due to\\\\nenormous repulsive force showing that\\\\nthe positive charge of the atom is not\\\\nspread throughout the atom as Thomson\\\\nhad presumed. The positive charge has\\\\nto be concentrated in a very small volume\\\\nthat repelled and deflected the positively\\\\ncharged α–particles.\\\\n(iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that\\\\nthe volume occupied by the nucleus is\\\\nnegligibly small as compared to the total\\\\nvolume of the atom. The radius of the\\\\natom is about 10–10 m, while that of\\\\nnucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate\\\\nthis difference in size by realising that if\\\\nFig. 2.5 Schematic view of Rutherford’s\\\\nscattering experiment.

Rutherford’s scattering experiment\\\\nB. Schematic molecular view of the gold foil\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 35\\\\n\\\\na cricket ball represents a nucleus, then\\\\nthe radius of atom would be about 5 km.\\\\nOn the basis of above observations and\\\\nconclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear\\\\nmodel of atom. According to this model:\\\\n\\\\n(i) The positive charge and most of the mass\\\\nof the atom was densely concentrated in\\\\nextremely small region. This very small\\\\nportion of the atom was called nucleus\\\\nby Rutherford.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) The nucleus is surrounded by electrons\\\\nthat move around the nucleus with a very\\\\nhigh speed in circular paths called orbits.\\\\nThus, Rutherford’s model of atom\\\\nresembles the solar system in which the\\\\nnucleus plays the role of sun and the\\\\nelectrons that of revolving planets.\\\\n\\\\n(iii) Electrons and the nucleus are held\\\\ntogether by electrostatic forces of\\\\nattraction.\\\\n\\\\n2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass Number\\\\n\\\\nThe presence of positive charge on the\\\\nnucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus.\\\\nAs established earlier, the charge on the\\\\nproton is equal but opposite to that of\\\\nelectron. The number of protons present in\\\\nthe nucleus is equal to atomic number ( Z ).\\\\nFor example, the number of protons in the\\\\nhydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is\\\\n11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and\\\\n11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical\\\\nneutrality, the number of electrons in an\\\\natom is equal to the number of protons\\\\n(atomic number, Z ). For example, number of\\\\nelectrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom\\\\nare 1 and 11 respectively.\\\\n\\\\nAtomic number ( Z ) = number of protons in\\\\nthe nucleus of an atom\\\\n= number of electrons\\\\nin a nuetral atom (2.3)\\\\nWhile the positive charge of the nucleus\\\\nis due to protons, the mass of the nucleus,\\\\ndue to protons and neutrons. As discussed\\\\nearlier protons and neutrons present in the\\\\nnucleus are collectively known as nucleons.\\\\n\\\\nThe total number of nucleons is termed as\\\\nmass number (A) of the atom.\\\\nmass number (A) = number of protons ( Z )\\\\n+ number of\\\\nneutrons (n) (2.4)\\\\n2.2.4 Isobars and Isotopes\\\\nThe composition of any atom can be\\\\nrepresented by using the normal element\\\\nsymbol (X) with super-script on the left hand\\\\nside as the atomic mass number (A) and\\\\nsubscript ( Z ) on the left hand side as the atomic\\\\nnumber (i.e., AZ X).\\\\nIsobars are the atoms with same mass\\\\nnumber but different atomic number for\\\\nexample,^146 C and^147 N. On the other hand, atoms\\\\nwith identical atomic number but different\\\\natomic mass number are known as Isotopes.\\\\nIn other words (according to equation 2.4), it\\\\nis evident that difference between the isotopes\\\\nis due to the presence of different number of\\\\nneutrons present in the nucleus. For example,\\\\nconsidering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985%\\\\nof hydrogen atoms contain only one proton.\\\\nThis isotope is called protium ( 1\\\\n1\\\\nH). Rest of the\\\\npercentage of hydrogen atom contains two other\\\\nisotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1\\\\nneutron is called deuterium ( 12 D, 0.015%)\\\\nand the other one possessing 1 proton and 2\\\\nneutrons is called tritium ( 1\\\\n3\\\\nT ). The latter\\\\nisotope is found in trace amounts on the earth.\\\\nOther examples of commonly occuring\\\\nisotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and\\\\n8 neutrons besides 6 protons (^126 C, C, C^136614 );\\\\nchlorine atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons\\\\nbesides 17 protons ( 1735 Cl, Cl 1737 ).\\\\nLastly an important point to mention\\\\nregarding isotopes is that chemical properties\\\\nof atoms are controlled by the number of\\\\nelectrons, which are determined by the\\\\nnumber of protons in the nucleus. Number of\\\\nneutrons present in the nucleus have very little\\\\neffect on the chemical properties of an element.\\\\nTherefore, all the isotopes of a given element\\\\nshow same chemical behaviour.\\\\n\\\\n36 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nProblem 2.1\\\\nCalculate the number of protons,\\\\nneutrons and electrons in 3580 Br.\\\\nSolution\\\\nIn this case, 3580 Br, Z = 35, A = 80, species\\\\nis neutral\\\\nNumber of protons = number of electrons\\\\n= Z = 35\\\\nNumber of neutrons = 80 – 35 = 45,\\\\n(equation 2.4)\\\\nProblem 2.2\\\\nThe number of electrons, protons and\\\\nneutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16\\\\nand 16 respectively. Assign the proper\\\\nsymbol to the species.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe atomic number is equal to\\\\nnumber of protons = 16. The element is\\\\nsulphur (S).\\\\nAtomic mass number = number of\\\\nprotons + number of neutrons\\\\n= 16 + 16 = 32\\\\nSpecies is not neutral as the number of\\\\nprotons is not equal to electrons. It is\\\\nanion (negatively charged) with charge\\\\nequal to excess electrons = 18 – 16 = 2.\\\\nSymbol is^3216 S2–.\\\\nNote : Before using the notation AZ X, find\\\\nout whether the species is a neutral atom,\\\\na cation or an anion. If it is a neutral atom,\\\\nequation (2.3) is valid, i.e., number of\\\\nprotons = number of electrons = atomic\\\\nnumber. If the species is an ion, determine\\\\nwhether the number of protons are larger\\\\n(cation, positive ion) or smaller (anion,\\\\nnegative ion) than the number of electrons.\\\\nNumber of neutrons is always given by\\\\nA–Z, whether the species is neutral or ion.\\\\n2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford Model\\\\n\\\\nAs you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear\\\\nmodel of an atom is like a small scale solar\\\\nsystem with the nucleus playing the role of the\\\\n\\\\nClassical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of\\\\nmacroscopic objects.\\\\n\\\\nmassive sun and the electrons being similar\\\\nto the lighter planets. When classical\\\\nmechanics* is applied to the solar system, it\\\\nshows that the planets describe well-defined\\\\norbits around the sun. The gravitational force\\\\nbetween the planets is given by the expression\\\\n\\\\nG.^122\\\\n\\\\nm m\\\\nr\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7 where m^1 and m^2 are the masses, r\\\\nis the distance of separation of the masses and\\\\nG is the gravitational constant. The theory can\\\\nalso calculate precisely the planetary orbits and\\\\nthese are in agreement with the experimental\\\\nmeasurements.\\\\nThe similarity between the solar system\\\\nand nuclear model suggests that electrons\\\\nshould move around the nucleus in well\\\\ndefined orbits. Further, the coulomb force\\\\n(k q 1 q 2 / r^2 where q 1 and q 2 are the charges, r is\\\\nthe distance of separation of the charges and\\\\nk is the proportionality constant) between\\\\nelectron and the nucleus is mathematically\\\\nsimilar to the gravitational force. However,\\\\nwhen a body is moving in an orbit, it\\\\nundergoes acceleration even if it is moving with\\\\na constant speed in an orbit because of\\\\nchanging direction. So an electron in the\\\\nnuclear model describing planet like orbits is\\\\nunder acceleration. According to the\\\\nelectromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged\\\\nparticles when accelerated should emit\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation (This feature does\\\\nnot exist for planets since they are uncharged).\\\\nTherefore, an electron in an orbit will emit\\\\nradiation, the energy carried by radiation\\\\ncomes from electronic motion. The orbit will\\\\nthus continue to shrink. Calculations show\\\\nthat it should take an electron only 10–8 s to\\\\nspiral into the nucleus. But this does not\\\\nhappen. Thus, the Rutherford model\\\\ncannot explain the stability of an atom.\\\\nIf the motion of an electron is described on the\\\\nbasis of the classical mechanics and\\\\nelectromagnetic theory, you may ask that\\\\nsince the motion of electrons in orbits is\\\\nleading to the instability of the atom, then\\\\nwhy not consider electrons as stationary\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 37\\\\n\\\\naround the nucleus. If the electrons were\\\\nstationary, electrostatic attraction between\\\\nthe dense nucleus and the electrons would\\\\npull the electrons toward the nucleus to form\\\\na miniature version of Thomson’s model\\\\nof atom.\\\\n\\\\nAnother serious drawback of the\\\\nRutherford model is that it says nothing about\\\\ndistribution of the electrons around the\\\\nnucleus and the energies of these electrons.\\\\n\\\\n2.3 Developments Leading to the Bohr’s Model of Atom\\\\n\\\\nHistorically, results observed from the studies\\\\nof interactions of radiations with matter have\\\\nprovided immense information regarding the\\\\nstructure of atoms and molecules. Neils Bohr\\\\nutilised these results to improve upon the\\\\nmodel proposed by Rutherford. Two\\\\ndevelopments played a major role in the\\\\nformulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These\\\\nwere:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Dual character of the electromagnetic\\\\nradiation which means that radiations\\\\npossess both wave like and particle like\\\\nproperties, and\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Experimental results regarding atomic\\\\nspectra.\\\\nFirst, we will discuss about the duel nature\\\\nof electromagnetic radiations. Experimental\\\\nresults regarding atomic spectra will be\\\\ndiscussed in Section 2.4.\\\\n\\\\n2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic\\\\nRadiation\\\\n\\\\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, physicists\\\\nactively studied absorption and emission of\\\\nradiation by heated objects. These are called\\\\nthermal radiations. They tried to find out of\\\\nwhat the thermal radiation is made. It is now\\\\na well-known fact that thermal radiations\\\\nconsist of electromagnetic waves of various\\\\nfrequencies or wavelengths. It is based on a\\\\nnumber of modern concepts, which were\\\\nunknown in the mid-nineteenth century. First\\\\nactive study of thermal radiation laws occured\\\\nin the 1850’s and the theory of electromagnetic\\\\nwaves and the emission of such waves by\\\\naccelerating charged particles was developed\\\\n\\\\nin the early 1870’s by James Clerk Maxwell,\\\\nwhich was experimentally confirmed later by\\\\nHeinrich Hertz. Here, we will learn some facts\\\\nabout electromagnetic radiations.\\\\nJames Maxwell (1870) was the first to give\\\\na comprehensive explanation about the\\\\ninteraction between the charged bodies and\\\\nthe behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields\\\\non macroscopic level. He suggested that when\\\\nelectrically charged particle moves under\\\\naccelaration, alternating electrical and\\\\nmagnetic fields are produced and transmitted.\\\\nThese fields are transmitted in the forms of\\\\nwaves called electromagnetic waves or\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation.\\\\nLight is the form of radiation known from\\\\nearly days and speculation about its nature\\\\ndates back to remote ancient times.

It was expected that the\\\\nparticles would slow down and change\\\\ndirections only by a small angles as they passed\\\\nthrough the foil. It was observed that:\\\\n(i) most of the α–particles passed through\\\\nthe gold foil undeflected.\\\\n(ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was\\\\ndeflected by small angles.\\\\n(iii) a very few α–particles (∼1 in 20,000)\\\\nbounced back, that is, were deflected by\\\\nnearly 180°.\\\\nOn the basis of the observations,\\\\nRutherford drew the following conclusions\\\\nregarding the structure of atom:\\\\n(i) Most of the space in the atom is empty as\\\\nmost of the α–particles passed through\\\\nthe foil undeflected.\\\\n(ii) A few positively charged α–particles were\\\\ndeflected. The deflection must be due to\\\\nenormous repulsive force showing that\\\\nthe positive charge of the atom is not\\\\nspread throughout the atom as Thomson\\\\nhad presumed. The positive charge has\\\\nto be concentrated in a very small volume\\\\nthat repelled and deflected the positively\\\\ncharged α–particles.\\\\n(iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that\\\\nthe volume occupied by the nucleus is\\\\nnegligibly small as compared to the total\\\\nvolume of the atom. The radius of the\\\\natom is about 10–10 m, while that of\\\\nnucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate\\\\nthis difference in size by realising that if\\\\nFig. 2.5 Schematic view of Rutherford’s\\\\nscattering experiment.

Schematic molecular view of the gold foil\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 35\\\\n\\\\na cricket ball represents a nucleus, then\\\\nthe radius of atom would be about 5 km.\\\\nOn the basis of above observations and\\\\nconclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear\\\\nmodel of atom. According to this model:\\\\n\\\\n(i) The positive charge and most of the mass\\\\nof the atom was densely concentrated in\\\\nextremely small region. This very small\\\\nportion of the atom was called nucleus\\\\nby Rutherford.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) The nucleus is surrounded by electrons\\\\nthat move around the nucleus with a very\\\\nhigh speed in circular paths called orbits.\\\\nThus, Rutherford’s model of atom\\\\nresembles the solar system in which the\\\\nnucleus plays the role of sun and the\\\\nelectrons that of revolving planets.\\\\n\\\\n(iii) Electrons and the nucleus are held\\\\ntogether by electrostatic forces of\\\\nattraction.\\\\n\\\\n2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass Number\\\\n\\\\nThe presence of positive charge on the\\\\nnucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus.\\\\nAs established earlier, the charge on the\\\\nproton is equal but opposite to that of\\\\nelectron. The number of protons present in\\\\nthe nucleus is equal to atomic number ( Z ).\\\\nFor example, the number of protons in the\\\\nhydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is\\\\n11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and\\\\n11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical\\\\nneutrality, the number of electrons in an\\\\natom is equal to the number of protons\\\\n(atomic number, Z ). For example, number of\\\\nelectrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom\\\\nare 1 and 11 respectively.\\\\n\\\\nAtomic number ( Z ) = number of protons in\\\\nthe nucleus of an atom\\\\n= number of electrons\\\\nin a nuetral atom (2.3)\\\\nWhile the positive charge of the nucleus\\\\nis due to protons, the mass of the nucleus,\\\\ndue to protons and neutrons. As discussed\\\\nearlier protons and neutrons present in the\\\\nnucleus are collectively known as nucleons.\\\\n\\\\nThe total number of nucleons is termed as\\\\nmass number (A) of the atom.\\\\nmass number (A) = number of protons ( Z )\\\\n+ number of\\\\nneutrons (n) (2.4)\\\\n2.2.4 Isobars and Isotopes\\\\nThe composition of any atom can be\\\\nrepresented by using the normal element\\\\nsymbol (X) with super-script on the left hand\\\\nside as the atomic mass number (A) and\\\\nsubscript ( Z ) on the left hand side as the atomic\\\\nnumber (i.e., AZ X).\\\\nIsobars are the atoms with same mass\\\\nnumber but different atomic number for\\\\nexample,^146 C and^147 N. On the other hand, atoms\\\\nwith identical atomic number but different\\\\natomic mass number are known as Isotopes.\\\\nIn other words (according to equation 2.4), it\\\\nis evident that difference between the isotopes\\\\nis due to the presence of different number of\\\\nneutrons present in the nucleus. For example,\\\\nconsidering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985%\\\\nof hydrogen atoms contain only one proton.\\\\nThis isotope is called protium ( 1\\\\n1\\\\nH). Rest of the\\\\npercentage of hydrogen atom contains two other\\\\nisotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1\\\\nneutron is called deuterium ( 12 D, 0.015%)\\\\nand the other one possessing 1 proton and 2\\\\nneutrons is called tritium ( 1\\\\n3\\\\nT ). The latter\\\\nisotope is found in trace amounts on the earth.\\\\nOther examples of commonly occuring\\\\nisotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and\\\\n8 neutrons besides 6 protons (^126 C, C, C^136614 );\\\\nchlorine atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons\\\\nbesides 17 protons ( 1735 Cl, Cl 1737 ).\\\\nLastly an important point to mention\\\\nregarding isotopes is that chemical properties\\\\nof atoms are controlled by the number of\\\\nelectrons, which are determined by the\\\\nnumber of protons in the nucleus. Number of\\\\nneutrons present in the nucleus have very little\\\\neffect on the chemical properties of an element.\\\\nTherefore, all the isotopes of a given element\\\\nshow same chemical behaviour.\\\\n\\\\n36 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nProblem 2.1\\\\nCalculate the number of protons,\\\\nneutrons and electrons in 3580 Br.\\\\nSolution\\\\nIn this case, 3580 Br, Z = 35, A = 80, species\\\\nis neutral\\\\nNumber of protons = number of electrons\\\\n= Z = 35\\\\nNumber of neutrons = 80 – 35 = 45,\\\\n(equation 2.4)\\\\nProblem 2.2\\\\nThe number of electrons, protons and\\\\nneutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16\\\\nand 16 respectively. Assign the proper\\\\nsymbol to the species.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe atomic number is equal to\\\\nnumber of protons = 16. The element is\\\\nsulphur (S).\\\\nAtomic mass number = number of\\\\nprotons + number of neutrons\\\\n= 16 + 16 = 32\\\\nSpecies is not neutral as the number of\\\\nprotons is not equal to electrons. It is\\\\nanion (negatively charged) with charge\\\\nequal to excess electrons = 18 – 16 = 2.\\\\nSymbol is^3216 S2–.\\\\nNote : Before using the notation AZ X, find\\\\nout whether the species is a neutral atom,\\\\na cation or an anion. If it is a neutral atom,\\\\nequation (2.3) is valid, i.e., number of\\\\nprotons = number of electrons = atomic\\\\nnumber. If the species is an ion, determine\\\\nwhether the number of protons are larger\\\\n(cation, positive ion) or smaller (anion,\\\\nnegative ion) than the number of electrons.\\\\nNumber of neutrons is always given by\\\\nA–Z, whether the species is neutral or ion.\\\\n2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford Model\\\\n\\\\nAs you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear\\\\nmodel of an atom is like a small scale solar\\\\nsystem with the nucleus playing the role of the\\\\n\\\\nClassical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of\\\\nmacroscopic objects.\\\\n\\\\nmassive sun and the electrons being similar\\\\nto the lighter planets. When classical\\\\nmechanics* is applied to the solar system, it\\\\nshows that the planets describe well-defined\\\\norbits around the sun. The gravitational force\\\\nbetween the planets is given by the expression\\\\n\\\\nG.^122\\\\n\\\\nm m\\\\nr\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7 where m^1 and m^2 are the masses, r\\\\nis the distance of separation of the masses and\\\\nG is the gravitational constant. The theory can\\\\nalso calculate precisely the planetary orbits and\\\\nthese are in agreement with the experimental\\\\nmeasurements.\\\\nThe similarity between the solar system\\\\nand nuclear model suggests that electrons\\\\nshould move around the nucleus in well\\\\ndefined orbits. Further, the coulomb force\\\\n(k q 1 q 2 / r^2 where q 1 and q 2 are the charges, r is\\\\nthe distance of separation of the charges and\\\\nk is the proportionality constant) between\\\\nelectron and the nucleus is mathematically\\\\nsimilar to the gravitational force. However,\\\\nwhen a body is moving in an orbit, it\\\\nundergoes acceleration even if it is moving with\\\\na constant speed in an orbit because of\\\\nchanging direction. So an electron in the\\\\nnuclear model describing planet like orbits is\\\\nunder acceleration. According to the\\\\nelectromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged\\\\nparticles when accelerated should emit\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation (This feature does\\\\nnot exist for planets since they are uncharged).\\\\nTherefore, an electron in an orbit will emit\\\\nradiation, the energy carried by radiation\\\\ncomes from electronic motion. The orbit will\\\\nthus continue to shrink. Calculations show\\\\nthat it should take an electron only 10–8 s to\\\\nspiral into the nucleus. But this does not\\\\nhappen. Thus, the Rutherford model\\\\ncannot explain the stability of an atom.\\\\nIf the motion of an electron is described on the\\\\nbasis of the classical mechanics and\\\\nelectromagnetic theory, you may ask that\\\\nsince the motion of electrons in orbits is\\\\nleading to the instability of the atom, then\\\\nwhy not consider electrons as stationary\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 37\\\\n\\\\naround the nucleus. If the electrons were\\\\nstationary, electrostatic attraction between\\\\nthe dense nucleus and the electrons would\\\\npull the electrons toward the nucleus to form\\\\na miniature version of Thomson’s model\\\\nof atom.\\\\n\\\\nAnother serious drawback of the\\\\nRutherford model is that it says nothing about\\\\ndistribution of the electrons around the\\\\nnucleus and the energies of these electrons.\\\\n\\\\n2.3 Developments Leading to the Bohr’s Model of Atom\\\\n\\\\nHistorically, results observed from the studies\\\\nof interactions of radiations with matter have\\\\nprovided immense information regarding the\\\\nstructure of atoms and molecules. Neils Bohr\\\\nutilised these results to improve upon the\\\\nmodel proposed by Rutherford. Two\\\\ndevelopments played a major role in the\\\\nformulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These\\\\nwere:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Dual character of the electromagnetic\\\\nradiation which means that radiations\\\\npossess both wave like and particle like\\\\nproperties, and\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Experimental results regarding atomic\\\\nspectra.\\\\nFirst, we will discuss about the duel nature\\\\nof electromagnetic radiations. Experimental\\\\nresults regarding atomic spectra will be\\\\ndiscussed in Section 2.4.\\\\n\\\\n2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic\\\\nRadiation\\\\n\\\\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, physicists\\\\nactively studied absorption and emission of\\\\nradiation by heated objects. These are called\\\\nthermal radiations. They tried to find out of\\\\nwhat the thermal radiation is made. It is now\\\\na well-known fact that thermal radiations\\\\nconsist of electromagnetic waves of various\\\\nfrequencies or wavelengths. It is based on a\\\\nnumber of modern concepts, which were\\\\nunknown in the mid-nineteenth century. First\\\\nactive study of thermal radiation laws occured\\\\nin the 1850’s and the theory of electromagnetic\\\\nwaves and the emission of such waves by\\\\naccelerating charged particles was developed\\\\n\\\\nin the early 1870’s by James Clerk Maxwell,\\\\nwhich was experimentally confirmed later by\\\\nHeinrich Hertz. Here, we will learn some facts\\\\nabout electromagnetic radiations.\\\\nJames Maxwell (1870) was the first to give\\\\na comprehensive explanation about the\\\\ninteraction between the charged bodies and\\\\nthe behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields\\\\non macroscopic level. He suggested that when\\\\nelectrically charged particle moves under\\\\naccelaration, alternating electrical and\\\\nmagnetic fields are produced and transmitted.\\\\nThese fields are transmitted in the forms of\\\\nwaves called electromagnetic waves or\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation.\\\\nLight is the form of radiation known from\\\\nearly days and speculation about its nature\\\\ndates back to remote ancient times. In earlier\\\\ndays (Newton) light was supposed to be made\\\\nof particles (corpuscules). It was only in the\\\\n19th century when wave nature of light was\\\\nestablished.\\\\nMaxwell was again the first to reveal that\\\\nlight waves are associated with oscillating\\\\nelectric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6).\\\\nAlthough electromagnetic wave motion is\\\\ncomplex in nature, we will consider here only\\\\na few simple properties.\\\\n(i) The oscillating electric and magnetic fields\\\\nproduced by oscillating charged particles\\\\nFig.2.6 The electric and magnetic field\\\\ncomponents of an electromagnetic wave.\\\\nThese components have the same\\\\nwavelength, frequency, speed and\\\\namplitude, but they vibrate in two\\\\nmutually perpendicular planes.\\\\n\\\\n38 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nare perpendicular to each other and both\\\\nare perpendicular to the direction of\\\\npropagation of the wave. Simplified\\\\npicture of electromagnetic wave is shown\\\\nin Fig. 2.6.\\\\n(ii) Unlike sound waves or waves produced\\\\nin water, electromagnetic waves do not\\\\nrequire medium and can move in\\\\nvacuum.\\\\n(iii) It is now well established that there are\\\\nmany types of electromagnetic radiations,\\\\nwhich differ from one another in\\\\nwavelength (or frequency). These\\\\nconstitute what is called electromagnetic\\\\nspectrum (Fig. 2.7). Different regions of\\\\nthe spectrum are identified by different\\\\nnames. Some examples are: radio\\\\nfrequency region around 10^6 Hz, used for\\\\nbroadcasting; microwave region around\\\\n1010 Hz used for radar; infrared region\\\\naround 10^13 Hz used for heating;\\\\nultraviolet region around 10^16 Hz a\\\\ncomponent of sun’s radiation. The small\\\\nportion around 10^15 Hz, is what is\\\\nordinarily called visible light. It is only\\\\nthis part which our eyes can see (or\\\\ndetect). Special instruments are required\\\\nto detect non-visible radiation.\\\\nFig. 2.7 (a) The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. (b) Visible spectrum. The visible region is only\\\\na small part of the entire spectrum.\\\\n\\\\n(iv) Different kinds of units are used to\\\\nrepresent electromagnetic radiation.\\\\nThese radiations are characterised by the\\\\nproperties, namely, frequency (ν) and\\\\nwavelength (λ).\\\\nThe SI unit for frequency (ν) is hertz\\\\n(Hz, s–1), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as\\\\nthe number of waves that pass a given point\\\\nin one second.\\\\nWavelength should have the units of length\\\\nand as you know that the SI units of length is\\\\nmeter (m). Since electromagnetic radiation\\\\nconsists of different kinds of waves of much\\\\nsmaller wavelengths, smaller units are used.\\\\nFig.2.7 shows various types of electro-\\\\nmagnetic radiations which differ from one\\\\nanother in wavelengths and frequencies.\\\\nIn vaccum all types of electromagnetic\\\\nradiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at\\\\nthe same speed, i.e., 3.0 × 10^8 m s–1 (2.997925\\\\n× 10^8 m s–1, to be precise). This is called speed\\\\nof light and is given the symbol ‘c‘. The\\\\nfrequency (ν ), wavelength (λ) and velocity of light\\\\n(c) are related by the equation (2.5).\\\\nc = ν λ (2.5)\\\\n(a)\\\\n\\\\n(b)\\\\nν\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 39\\\\nThe other commonly used quantity\\\\nspecially in spectroscopy, is the wavenumber\\\\n( ). It is defined as the number of wavelengths\\\\nper unit length. Its units are reciprocal of\\\\nwavelength unit, i.e., m–1. However commonly\\\\nused unit is cm–1 (not SI unit).\\\\n\\\\n40 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special\\\\nreference to hydrogen.\\\\nThese phenomena indicate that the system\\\\ncan take energy only in discrete amounts. All\\\\npossible energies cannot be taken up or\\\\nradiated.\\\\nIt is noteworthy that the first concrete\\\\nexplanation for the phenomenon of the black\\\\nbody radiation mentioned above was given by\\\\nMax Planck in 1900. Let us first try to\\\\nunderstand this phenomenon, which is given\\\\nbelow:\\\\nHot objects emit electromagnetic radiations\\\\nover a wide range of wavelengths. At high\\\\ntemperatures, an appreciable proportion of\\\\nradiation is in the visible region of the\\\\nspectrum. As the temperature is raised, a\\\\nhigher proportion of short wavelength (blue\\\\nlight) is generated. For example, when an iron\\\\nrod is heated in a furnace, it first turns to dull\\\\nred and then progressively becomes more and\\\\nmore red as the temperature increases. As this\\\\nis heated further, the radiation emitted becomes\\\\nwhite and then becomes blue as the\\\\ntemperature becomes very high. This means\\\\nthat red radiation is most intense at a particular\\\\ntemperature and the blue radiation is more\\\\nintense at another temperature. This means\\\\nintensities of radiations of different wavelengths\\\\nemitted by hot body depend upon its\\\\ntemperature. By late 1850’s it was known that\\\\nobjects made of different material and kept at\\\\ndifferent temperatures emit different amount of\\\\nradiation. Also, when the surface of an object is\\\\nirradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation),\\\\na part of radiant energy is generally reflected\\\\nas such, a part is absorbed and a part of it is\\\\ntransmitted. The reason for incomplete\\\\nabsorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule\\\\nimperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body,\\\\nwhich emits and absorbs radiations of all\\\\nfrequencies uniformly, is called a black body\\\\nand the radiation emitted by such a body is\\\\ncalled black body radiation. In practice, no\\\\nsuch body exists. Carbon black approximates\\\\nfairly closely to black body. A good physical\\\\napproximation to a black body is a cavity with\\\\na tiny hole, which has no other opening. Any\\\\nray entering the hole will be reflected by the\\\\ncavity walls and will be eventually absorbed by\\\\nthe walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator\\\\n\\\\nof radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body\\\\nis in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.\\\\nIt radiates same amount of energy per unit area\\\\nas it absorbs from its surrounding in any given\\\\ntime. The amount of light emitted (intensity of\\\\nradiation) from a black body and its spectral\\\\ndistribution depends only on its temperature.\\\\nAt a given temperature, intensity of radiation\\\\nemitted increases with the increase of\\\\nwavelength, reaches a maximum value at a\\\\ngiven wavelength and then starts decreasing\\\\nwith further increase of wavelength, as shown\\\\nin Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases,\\\\nmaxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength.\\\\nSeveral attempts were made to predict the\\\\nintensity of radiation as a function of\\\\nwavelength.\\\\nBut the results of the above experiment\\\\ncould not be explained satisfactorily on the\\\\nbasis of the wave theory of light. Max Planck\\\\nFig. 2.8(a) Black body\\\\nFig. 2.8 Wavelength-intensity relationship\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 41\\\\n\\\\narrived at a satisfactory relationship by\\\\nmaking an assumption that absorption and\\\\nemmission of radiation arises from oscillator\\\\ni.e., atoms in the wall of black body. Their\\\\nfrequency of oscillation is changed by\\\\ninteraction with oscilators of electromagnetic\\\\nradiation. Planck assumed that radiation\\\\ncould be sub-divided into discrete chunks of\\\\nenergy. He suggested that atoms and\\\\nmolecules could emit or absorb energy only\\\\nin discrete quantities and not in a continuous\\\\nmanner. He gave the name quantum to the\\\\nsmallest quantity of energy that can be\\\\nemitted or absorbed in the form of\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation. The energy ( E ) of a\\\\nquantum of radiation is proportional\\\\nto its frequency (ν ) and is expressed by\\\\nequation (2.6).\\\\n\\\\nE = h υ (2.6)\\\\n\\\\nThe proportionality constant, ‘ h ’ is known\\\\nas Planck’s constant and has the value\\\\n6.626×10–34 J s.\\\\n\\\\nWith this theory, Planck was able to explain\\\\nthe distribution of intensity in the radiation\\\\nfrom black body as a function of frequency or\\\\nwavelength at different temperatures.\\\\n\\\\nQuantisation has been compared to\\\\nstanding on a staircase. A person can stand\\\\non any step of a staircase, but it is not possible\\\\nfor him/her to stand in between the two steps.\\\\nThe energy can take any one of the values from\\\\nthe following set, but cannot take on any\\\\nvalues between them.\\\\n\\\\nE = 0, h υ, 2 h υ, 3 h υ.... nh υ.....\\\\nPhotoelectric Effect\\\\nIn 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting\\\\nexperiment in which electrons (or electric\\\\ncurrent) were ejected when certain metals (for\\\\nexample potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.)\\\\nwere exposed to a beam of light as shown\\\\nin Fig.2.9. The phenomenon is called\\\\nPhotoelectric effect. The results observed in\\\\nthis experiment were:\\\\n(i) The electrons are ejected from the metal\\\\nsurface as soon as the beam of light strikes\\\\nthe surface, i.e., there is no time lag\\\\nbetween the striking of light beam and the\\\\nejection of electrons from the metal surface.\\\\n(ii) The number of electrons ejected is\\\\nproportional to the intensity or brightness\\\\nof light.\\\\n(iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic\\\\nminimum frequency,ν 0 (also known as\\\\nthreshold frequency) below which\\\\nphotoelectric effect is not observed. At a\\\\nfrequency ν >ν 0 , the ejected electrons come\\\\nout with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic\\\\nenergies of these electrons increase with\\\\nthe increase of frequency of the light used.\\\\nAll the above results could not be explained\\\\non the basis of laws of classical physics.\\\\nAccording to latter, the energy content of the\\\\nbeam of light depends upon the brightness of\\\\nthe light. In other words, number of electrons\\\\nejected and kinetic energy associated with\\\\nthem should depend on the brightness of light.\\\\nIt has been observed that though the number\\\\nof electrons ejected does depend upon the\\\\nbrightness of light, the kinetic energy of the\\\\nFig.2.9 Equipment for studying the photoelectric\\\\neffect. Light of a particular frequency strikes\\\\na clean metal surface inside a vacuum\\\\nchamber. Electrons are ejected from the\\\\nmetal and are counted by a detector that\\\\nmeasures their kinetic energy.\\\\n\\\\nMax Planck\\\\n(1858 – 1947)\\\\nMax Planck, a German physicist,\\\\nreceived his Ph.D in theoretical\\\\nphysics from the University of\\\\nMunich in 1879. In 1888, he was\\\\nappointed Director of the Institute\\\\nof Theoretical Physics at the\\\\nUniversity of Berlin. Planck was awarded the Nobel\\\\nPrize in Physics in 1918 for his quantum theory.\\\\nPlanck also made significant contributions in\\\\nthermodynamics and other areas of physics.\\\\n\\\\n42 CHEMISTRY\\\\nejected electrons does not. For example, red\\\\nlight [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 10^14 Hz] of any brightness\\\\n(intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium\\\\nmetal for hours but no photoelectrons are\\\\nejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow\\\\nlight (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 10^14 Hz) shines on the\\\\npotassium metal, the photoelectric effect is\\\\nobserved. The threshold frequency (ν 0 ) for\\\\npotassium metal is 5.0×10^14 Hz.\\\\nEinstein (1905) was able to explain the\\\\nphotoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum\\\\ntheory of electromagnetic radiation as a\\\\nstarting point.\\\\nminimum energy required to eject the electron\\\\nis h ν 0 (also called work function, W 0 ; Table 2.2),\\\\nthen the difference in energy\\\\n( h ν – h ν 0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of\\\\nthe photoelectron. Following the conservation\\\\nof energy principle, the kinetic energy of the\\\\nejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.\\\\n(2.7)\\\\nwhere m e is the mass of the electron and v is\\\\nthe velocity associated with the ejected electron.\\\\nLastly, a more intense beam of light consists\\\\nof larger number of photons, consequently the\\\\nnumber of electrons ejected is also larger as\\\\ncompared to that in an experiment in which a\\\\nbeam of weaker intensity of light is employed.\\\\nDual Behaviour of Electromagnetic\\\\nRadiation\\\\nThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma\\\\nfor scientists. On the one hand, it could explain\\\\nthe black body radiation and photoelectric\\\\neffect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it\\\\nwas not consistent with the known wave\\\\nbehaviour of light which could account for the\\\\nphenomena of interference and diffraction. The\\\\nonly way to resolve the dilemma was to accept\\\\nthe idea that light possesses both particle and\\\\nwave-like properties, i.e., light has dual\\\\nbehaviour. Depending on the experiment, we\\\\nfind that light behaves either as a wave or as a\\\\nstream of particles. Whenever radiation\\\\ninteracts with matter, it displays particle like\\\\nproperties in contrast to the wavelike\\\\nproperties (interference and diffraction), which\\\\nit exhibits when it propagates. This concept\\\\nwas totally alien to the way the scientists\\\\nthought about matter and radiation and it took\\\\nthem a long time to become convinced of its\\\\nvalidity. It turns out, as you shall see later,\\\\nthat some microscopic particles like electrons\\\\nalso exhibit this wave-particle duality.\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\Chemistry XI\\\\\\\\Unit-2\\\\\\\\Unit-2(2)-Lay-3(reprint).pmd 27.7.6, 16.10.6 (Reprint)\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 43\\\\n\\\\nProblem 2.6\\\\nCalculate energy of one mole of photons\\\\nof radiation whose frequency is 5 × 1014\\\\nHz.\\\\nSolution\\\\nEnergy ( E ) of one photon is given by the\\\\nexpression\\\\nE = h ν\\\\nh = 6.626 ×10–34 J s\\\\nν = 5×10^14 s–1 (given)\\\\nE = (6.626 ×10–34 J s) × (5 ×10^14 s–1)\\\\n= 3.313 ×10–19 J\\\\nEnergy of one mole of photons\\\\n= (3.313 ×10–19 J) × (6.022 × 10^23 mol–1)\\\\n= 199.51 kJ mol–1\\\\nProblem 2.7\\\\nA 100 watt bulb emits monochromatic\\\\nlight of wavelength 400 nm.

As a\\\\nresult, the beam of light is deviated or refracted\\\\nfrom its original path as it passes from one\\\\nmedium to another. It is observed that when a\\\\nray of white light is passed through a prism,\\\\nthe wave with shorter wavelength bends more\\\\nthan the one with a longer wavelength. Since\\\\nordinary white light consists of waves with all\\\\nthe wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of\\\\nwhite light is spread out into a series of\\\\ncoloured bands called spectrum. The light of\\\\nred colour which has longest wavelength is\\\\ndeviated the least while the violet light, which\\\\nhas shortest wavelength is deviated the most.\\\\nThe spectrum of white light, that we can see,\\\\nranges from violet at 7.50 × 1014 Hz to red at\\\\n4 × 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called\\\\ncontinuous spectrum. Continuous because\\\\nviolet merges into blue, blue into green and so\\\\non. A similar spectrum is produced when a\\\\nrainbow forms in the sky. Remember that\\\\nvisible light is just a small portion of the\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation interacts with matter,\\\\natoms and molecules may absorb energy and\\\\nreach to a higher energy state. With higher\\\\nenergy, these are in an unstable state. For\\\\nreturning to their normal (more stable, lower\\\\nenergy states) energy state, the atoms and\\\\nmolecules emit radiations in various regions\\\\nof the electromagnetic spectrum.\\\\n\\\\nEmission and Absorption Spectra\\\\n\\\\nThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a\\\\nsubstance that has absorbed energy is called\\\\nan emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or\\\\nions that have absorbed radiation are said to\\\\nbe “excited”. To produce an emission\\\\nspectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by\\\\nheating it or irradiating it and the wavelength\\\\n(or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the\\\\nsample gives up the absorbed energy, is\\\\nrecorded.\\\\nAn absorption spectrum is like the\\\\nphotographic negative of an emission\\\\n\\\\nspectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed\\\\nthrough a sample which absorbs radiation of\\\\ncertain wavelengths. The missing wavelength\\\\nwhich corresponds to the radiation absorbed\\\\nby the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright\\\\ncontinuous spectrum.\\\\nThe study of emission or absorption\\\\nspectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The\\\\nspectrum of the visible light, as discussed\\\\nabove, was continuous as all wavelengths (red\\\\nto violet) of the visible light are represented in\\\\nthe spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in\\\\nthe gas phase, on the other hand, do not show\\\\na continuous spread of wavelength from red\\\\nto violet, rather they emit light only at specific\\\\nwavelengths with dark spaces between them.\\\\nSuch spectra are called line spectra or atomic\\\\nspectra because the emitted radiation is\\\\nidentified by the appearance of bright lines in\\\\nthe spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).\\\\nLine emission spectra are of great\\\\ninterest in the study of electronic structure.\\\\nEach element has a unique line emission\\\\nspectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic\\\\nspectra can be used in chemical analysis to\\\\nidentify unknown atoms in the same way as\\\\nfingerprints are used to identify people. The\\\\nexact matching of lines of the emission\\\\nspectrum of the atoms of a known element with\\\\nthe lines from an unknown sample quickly\\\\nestablishes the identity of the latter, German\\\\nchemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was one\\\\nof the', 'made\\\\nof particles (corpuscules). It was only in the\\\\n19th century when wave nature of light was\\\\nestablished.\\\\nMaxwell was again the first to reveal that\\\\nlight waves are associated with oscillating\\\\nelectric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6).\\\\nAlthough electromagnetic wave motion is\\\\ncomplex in nature, we will consider here only\\\\na few simple properties.\\\\n(i) The oscillating electric and magnetic fields\\\\nproduced by oscillating charged particles\\\\nFig.2.6 The electric and magnetic field\\\\ncomponents of an electromagnetic wave.\\\\nThese components have the same\\\\nwavelength, frequency, speed and\\\\namplitude, but they vibrate in two\\\\nmutually perpendicular planes.\\\\n\\\\n38 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nare perpendicular to each other and both\\\\nare perpendicular to the direction of\\\\npropagation of the wave. Simplified\\\\npicture of electromagnetic wave is shown\\\\nin Fig. 2.6.\\\\n(ii) Unlike sound waves or waves produced\\\\nin water, electromagnetic waves do not\\\\nrequire medium and can move in\\\\nvacuum.\\\\n(iii) It is now well established that there are\\\\nmany types of electromagnetic radiations,\\\\nwhich differ from one another in\\\\nwavelength (or frequency). These\\\\nconstitute what is called electromagnetic\\\\nspectrum (Fig. 2.7). Different regions of\\\\nthe spectrum are identified by different\\\\nnames. Some examples are: radio\\\\nfrequency region around 10^6 Hz, used for\\\\nbroadcasting; microwave region around\\\\n1010 Hz used for radar; infrared region\\\\naround 10^13 Hz used for heating;\\\\nultraviolet region around 10^16 Hz a\\\\ncomponent of sun’s radiation. The small\\\\nportion around 10^15 Hz, is what is\\\\nordinarily called visible light. It is only\\\\nthis part which our eyes can see (or\\\\ndetect). Special instruments are required\\\\nto detect non-visible radiation.\\\\nFig. 2.7 (a) The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. (b) Visible spectrum. The visible region is only\\\\na small part of the entire spectrum.\\\\n\\\\n(iv) Different kinds of units are used to\\\\nrepresent electromagnetic radiation.\\\\nThese radiations are characterised by the\\\\nproperties, namely, frequency (ν) and\\\\nwavelength (λ).\\\\nThe SI unit for frequency (ν) is hertz\\\\n(Hz, s–1), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as\\\\nthe number of waves that pass a given point\\\\nin one second.\\\\nWavelength should have the units of length\\\\nand as you know that the SI units of length is\\\\nmeter (m). Since electromagnetic radiation\\\\nconsists of different kinds of waves of much\\\\nsmaller wavelengths, smaller units are used.\\\\nFig.2.7 shows various types of electro-\\\\nmagnetic radiations which differ from one\\\\nanother in wavelengths and frequencies.\\\\nIn vaccum all types of electromagnetic\\\\nradiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at\\\\nthe same speed, i.e., 3.0 × 10^8 m s–1 (2.997925\\\\n× 10^8 m s–1, to be precise). This is called speed\\\\nof light and is given the symbol ‘c‘. The\\\\nfrequency (ν ), wavelength (λ) and velocity of light\\\\n(c) are related by the equation (2.5).\\\\nc = ν λ (2.5)\\\\n(a)\\\\n\\\\n(b)\\\\nν\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 39\\\\nThe other commonly used quantity\\\\nspecially in spectroscopy, is the wavenumber\\\\n( ). It is defined as the number of wavelengths\\\\nper unit length. Its units are reciprocal of\\\\nwavelength unit, i.e., m–1. However commonly\\\\nused unit is cm–1 (not SI unit).\\\\n\\\\n40 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special\\\\nreference to hydrogen.\\\\nThese phenomena indicate that the system\\\\ncan take energy only in discrete amounts. All\\\\npossible energies cannot be taken up or\\\\nradiated.\\\\nIt is noteworthy that the first concrete\\\\nexplanation for the phenomenon of the black\\\\nbody radiation mentioned above was given by\\\\nMax Planck in 1900. Let us first try to\\\\nunderstand this phenomenon, which is given\\\\nbelow:\\\\nHot objects emit electromagnetic radiations\\\\nover a wide range of wavelengths. At high\\\\ntemperatures, an appreciable proportion of\\\\nradiation is in the visible region of the\\\\nspectrum. As the temperature is raised, a\\\\nhigher proportion of short wavelength (blue\\\\nlight) is generated. For example, when an iron\\\\nrod is heated in a furnace, it first turns to dull\\\\nred and then progressively becomes more and\\\\nmore red as the temperature increases. As this\\\\nis heated further, the radiation emitted becomes\\\\nwhite and then becomes blue as the\\\\ntemperature becomes very high. This means\\\\nthat red radiation is most intense at a particular\\\\ntemperature and the blue radiation is more\\\\nintense at another temperature. This means\\\\nintensities of radiations of different wavelengths\\\\nemitted by hot body depend upon its\\\\ntemperature. By late 1850’s it was known that\\\\nobjects made of different material and kept at\\\\ndifferent temperatures emit different amount of\\\\nradiation. Also, when the surface of an object is\\\\nirradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation),\\\\na part of radiant energy is generally reflected\\\\nas such, a part is absorbed and a part of it is\\\\ntransmitted. The reason for incomplete\\\\nabsorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule\\\\nimperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body,\\\\nwhich emits and absorbs radiations of all\\\\nfrequencies uniformly, is called a black body\\\\nand the radiation emitted by such a body is\\\\ncalled black body radiation. In practice, no\\\\nsuch body exists. Carbon black approximates\\\\nfairly closely to black body. A good physical\\\\napproximation to a black body is a cavity with\\\\na tiny hole, which has no other opening. Any\\\\nray entering the hole will be reflected by the\\\\ncavity walls and will be eventually absorbed by\\\\nthe walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator\\\\n\\\\nof radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body\\\\nis in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.\\\\nIt radiates same amount of energy per unit area\\\\nas it absorbs from its surrounding in any given\\\\ntime. The amount of light emitted (intensity of\\\\nradiation) from a black body and its spectral\\\\ndistribution depends only on its temperature.\\\\nAt a given temperature, intensity of radiation\\\\nemitted increases with the increase of\\\\nwavelength, reaches a maximum value at a\\\\ngiven wavelength and then starts decreasing\\\\nwith further increase of wavelength, as shown\\\\nin Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases,\\\\nmaxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength.\\\\nSeveral attempts were made to predict the\\\\nintensity of radiation as a function of\\\\nwavelength.\\\\nBut the results of the above experiment\\\\ncould not be explained satisfactorily on the\\\\nbasis of the wave theory of light. Max Planck\\\\nFig. 2.8(a) Black body\\\\nFig. 2.8 Wavelength-intensity relationship\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 41\\\\n\\\\narrived at a satisfactory relationship by\\\\nmaking an assumption that absorption and\\\\nemmission of radiation arises from oscillator\\\\ni.e., atoms in the wall of black body. Their\\\\nfrequency of oscillation is changed by\\\\ninteraction with oscilators of electromagnetic\\\\nradiation. Planck assumed that radiation\\\\ncould be sub-divided into discrete chunks of\\\\nenergy. He suggested that atoms and\\\\nmolecules could emit or absorb energy only\\\\nin discrete quantities and not in a continuous\\\\nmanner. He gave the name quantum to the\\\\nsmallest quantity of energy that can be\\\\nemitted or absorbed in the form of\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation. The energy ( E ) of a\\\\nquantum of radiation is proportional\\\\nto its frequency (ν ) and is expressed by\\\\nequation (2.6).\\\\n\\\\nE = h υ (2.6)\\\\n\\\\nThe proportionality constant, ‘ h ’ is known\\\\nas Planck’s constant and has the value\\\\n6.626×10–34 J s.\\\\n\\\\nWith this theory, Planck was able to explain\\\\nthe distribution of intensity in the radiation\\\\nfrom black body as a function of frequency or\\\\nwavelength at different temperatures.\\\\n\\\\nQuantisation has been compared to\\\\nstanding on a staircase. A person can stand\\\\non any step of a staircase, but it is not possible\\\\nfor him/her to stand in between the two steps.\\\\nThe energy can take any one of the values from\\\\nthe following set, but cannot take on any\\\\nvalues between them.\\\\n\\\\nE = 0, h υ, 2 h υ, 3 h υ.... nh υ.....\\\\nPhotoelectric Effect\\\\nIn 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting\\\\nexperiment in which electrons (or electric\\\\ncurrent) were ejected when certain metals (for\\\\nexample potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.)\\\\nwere exposed to a beam of light as shown\\\\nin Fig.2.9. The phenomenon is called\\\\nPhotoelectric effect. The results observed in\\\\nthis experiment were:\\\\n(i) The electrons are ejected from the metal\\\\nsurface as soon as the beam of light strikes\\\\nthe surface, i.e., there is no time lag\\\\nbetween the striking of light beam and the\\\\nejection of electrons from the metal surface.\\\\n(ii) The number of electrons ejected is\\\\nproportional to the intensity or brightness\\\\nof light.\\\\n(iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic\\\\nminimum frequency,ν 0 (also known as\\\\nthreshold frequency) below which\\\\nphotoelectric effect is not observed. At a\\\\nfrequency ν >ν 0 , the ejected electrons come\\\\nout with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic\\\\nenergies of these electrons increase with\\\\nthe increase of frequency of the light used.\\\\nAll the above results could not be explained\\\\non the basis of laws of classical physics.\\\\nAccording to latter, the energy content of the\\\\nbeam of light depends upon the brightness of\\\\nthe light. In other words, number of electrons\\\\nejected and kinetic energy associated with\\\\nthem should depend on the brightness of light.\\\\nIt has been observed that though the number\\\\nof electrons ejected does depend upon the\\\\nbrightness of light, the kinetic energy of the\\\\nFig.2.9 Equipment for studying the photoelectric\\\\neffect. Light of a particular frequency strikes\\\\na clean metal surface inside a vacuum\\\\nchamber. Electrons are ejected from the\\\\nmetal and are counted by a detector that\\\\nmeasures their kinetic energy.\\\\n\\\\nMax Planck\\\\n(1858 – 1947)\\\\nMax Planck, a German physicist,\\\\nreceived his Ph.D in theoretical\\\\nphysics from the University of\\\\nMunich in 1879. In 1888, he was\\\\nappointed Director of the Institute\\\\nof Theoretical Physics at the\\\\nUniversity of Berlin. Planck was awarded the Nobel\\\\nPrize in Physics in 1918 for his quantum theory.\\\\nPlanck also made significant contributions in\\\\nthermodynamics and other areas of physics.\\\\n\\\\n42 CHEMISTRY\\\\nejected electrons does not. For example, red\\\\nlight [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 10^14 Hz] of any brightness\\\\n(intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium\\\\nmetal for hours but no photoelectrons are\\\\nejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow\\\\nlight (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 10^14 Hz) shines on the\\\\npotassium metal, the photoelectric effect is\\\\nobserved. The threshold frequency (ν 0 ) for\\\\npotassium metal is 5.0×10^14 Hz.\\\\nEinstein (1905) was able to explain the\\\\nphotoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum\\\\ntheory of electromagnetic radiation as a\\\\nstarting point.\\\\nminimum energy required to eject the electron\\\\nis h ν 0 (also called work function, W 0 ; Table 2.2),\\\\nthen the difference in energy\\\\n( h ν – h ν 0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of\\\\nthe photoelectron. Following the conservation\\\\nof energy principle, the kinetic energy of the\\\\nejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.\\\\n(2.7)\\\\nwhere m e is the mass of the electron and v is\\\\nthe velocity associated with the ejected electron.\\\\nLastly, a more intense beam of light consists\\\\nof larger number of photons, consequently the\\\\nnumber of electrons ejected is also larger as\\\\ncompared to that in an experiment in which a\\\\nbeam of weaker intensity of light is employed.\\\\nDual Behaviour of Electromagnetic\\\\nRadiation\\\\nThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma\\\\nfor scientists. On the one hand, it could explain\\\\nthe black body radiation and photoelectric\\\\neffect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it\\\\nwas not consistent with the known wave\\\\nbehaviour of light which could account for the\\\\nphenomena of interference and diffraction. The\\\\nonly way to resolve the dilemma was to accept\\\\nthe idea that light possesses both particle and\\\\nwave-like properties, i.e., light has dual\\\\nbehaviour. Depending on the experiment, we\\\\nfind that light behaves either as a wave or as a\\\\nstream of particles. Whenever radiation\\\\ninteracts with matter, it displays particle like\\\\nproperties in contrast to the wavelike\\\\nproperties (interference and diffraction), which\\\\nit exhibits when it propagates. This concept\\\\nwas totally alien to the way the scientists\\\\nthought about matter and radiation and it took\\\\nthem a long time to become convinced of its\\\\nvalidity. It turns out, as you shall see later,\\\\nthat some microscopic particles like electrons\\\\nalso exhibit this wave-particle duality.\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\Chemistry XI\\\\\\\\Unit-2\\\\\\\\Unit-2(2)-Lay-3(reprint).pmd 27.7.6, 16.10.6 (Reprint)\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 43\\\\n\\\\nProblem 2.6\\\\nCalculate energy of one mole of photons\\\\nof radiation whose frequency is 5 × 1014\\\\nHz.\\\\nSolution\\\\nEnergy ( E ) of one photon is given by the\\\\nexpression\\\\nE = h ν\\\\nh = 6.626 ×10–34 J s\\\\nν = 5×10^14 s–1 (given)\\\\nE = (6.626 ×10–34 J s) × (5 ×10^14 s–1)\\\\n= 3.313 ×10–19 J\\\\nEnergy of one mole of photons\\\\n= (3.313 ×10–19 J) × (6.022 × 10^23 mol–1)\\\\n= 199.51 kJ mol–1\\\\nProblem 2.7\\\\nA 100 watt bulb emits monochromatic\\\\nlight of wavelength 400 nm.

As a\\\\nresult, the beam of light is deviated or refracted\\\\nfrom its original path as it passes from one\\\\nmedium to another. It is observed that when a\\\\nray of white light is passed through a prism,\\\\nthe wave with shorter wavelength bends more\\\\nthan the one with a longer wavelength. Since\\\\nordinary white light consists of waves with all\\\\nthe wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of\\\\nwhite light is spread out into a series of\\\\ncoloured bands called spectrum. The light of\\\\nred colour which has longest wavelength is\\\\ndeviated the least while the violet light, which\\\\nhas shortest wavelength is deviated the most.\\\\nThe spectrum of white light, that we can see,\\\\nranges from violet at 7.50 × 1014 Hz to red at\\\\n4 × 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called\\\\ncontinuous spectrum. Continuous because\\\\nviolet merges into blue, blue into green and so\\\\non. A similar spectrum is produced when a\\\\nrainbow forms in the sky. Remember that\\\\nvisible light is just a small portion of the\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation interacts with matter,\\\\natoms and molecules may absorb energy and\\\\nreach to a higher energy state. With higher\\\\nenergy, these are in an unstable state. For\\\\nreturning to their normal (more stable, lower\\\\nenergy states) energy state, the atoms and\\\\nmolecules emit radiations in various regions\\\\nof the electromagnetic spectrum.\\\\n\\\\nEmission and Absorption Spectra\\\\n\\\\nThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a\\\\nsubstance that has absorbed energy is called\\\\nan emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or\\\\nions that have absorbed radiation are said to\\\\nbe “excited”. To produce an emission\\\\nspectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by\\\\nheating it or irradiating it and the wavelength\\\\n(or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the\\\\nsample gives up the absorbed energy, is\\\\nrecorded.\\\\nAn absorption spectrum is like the\\\\nphotographic negative of an emission\\\\n\\\\nspectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed\\\\nthrough a sample which absorbs radiation of\\\\ncertain wavelengths. The missing wavelength\\\\nwhich corresponds to the radiation absorbed\\\\nby the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright\\\\ncontinuous spectrum.\\\\nThe study of emission or absorption\\\\nspectra is referred to as spectroscopy.

The element helium (He) was\\\\ndiscovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.\\\\nLine Spectrum of Hydrogen\\\\nWhen an electric discharge is passed through\\\\ngaseous hydrogen, the H 2 molecules dissociate\\\\nand the energetically excited hydrogen atoms\\\\nproduced emit electromagnetic radiation of\\\\ndiscrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum\\\\nconsists of several series of lines named after\\\\ntheir discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on\\\\nthe basis of experimental observations that if\\\\n* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 45\\\\n\\\\nspectral lines are expressed in terms of\\\\nwavenumber ( ), then the visible lines of the\\\\nhydrogen spectrum obey the following formula:\\\\n\\\\n(2.8)\\\\n\\\\nwhere n is an integer equal to or greater than\\\\n3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....)\\\\nThe series of lines described by this formula\\\\nare called the Balmer series. The Balmer series\\\\nof lines are the only lines in the hydrogen\\\\nspectrum which appear in the visible region\\\\nof the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish\\\\nspectroscopist, Johannes Rydberg, noted that\\\\nall series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum\\\\ncould be described by the following\\\\nexpression :\\\\n\\\\n(2.9)\\\\n\\\\nwhere n 1 =1,2........\\\\n\\\\nn 2 = n 1 + 1, n 1 + 2......\\\\n\\\\nThe value 109,677 cm–1 is called the\\\\nRydberg constant for hydrogen.

There\\\\nare, however, certain features which are\\\\ncommon to all line spectra, i.e., (i) line spectrum\\\\nof element is unique and (ii) there is regularity\\\\nin the line spectrum of each element. The\\\\nquestions which arise are: What are the\\\\nreasons for these similarities? Is it something\\\\nto do with the electronic structure of atoms?\\\\nThese are the questions need to be answered.\\\\nWe shall find later that the answers to these\\\\nquestions provide the key in understanding\\\\nelectronic structure of these elements.\\\\n\\\\n2.4 Bohr’s Model for Hydrogen Atom\\\\n\\\\nNeils Bohr (1913) was the first to explain\\\\nquantitatively the general features of the\\\\nstructure of hydrogen atom and its spectrum.\\\\nHe used Planck’s concept of quantisation of\\\\nenergy. Though the theory is not the modern\\\\nquantum mechanics, it can still be used to\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.11 Transitions of the electron in the\\\\nhydrogen atom (The diagram shows\\\\nthe Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series\\\\nof transitions)\\\\nrationalize many points in the atomic structure\\\\nand spectra. Bohr’s model for hydrogen atom\\\\nis based on the following postulates:\\\\ni) The electron in the hydrogen atom can\\\\nmove around the nucleus in a circular path\\\\nof fixed radius and energy. These paths are\\\\ncalled orbits, stationary states or allowed\\\\nenergy states. These orbits are arranged\\\\nconcentrically around the nucleus.\\\\nii) The energy of an electron in the orbit does\\\\nnot change with time. However, the\\\\nelectron will move from a lower stationary\\\\nstate to a higher stationary state when\\\\nrequired amount of energy is absorbed\\\\nby the electron or energy is emitted when\\\\nelectron moves from higher stationary\\\\nstate to lower stationary state (equation\\\\n2.16). The energy change does not take\\\\nplace in a continuous manner.\\\\nAngular Momentum\\\\nJust as linear momentum is the product\\\\nof mass ( m ) and linear velocity (v), angular\\\\nmomentum is the product of moment of\\\\ninertia ( I ) and angular velocity (ω). For an\\\\nelectron of mass m e, moving in a circular\\\\npath of radius r around the nucleus,\\\\nangular momentum = I × ω\\\\nSince I = m er^2 , and ω = v/ r where v is the\\\\nlinear velocity,\\\\n∴angular momentum = m e r^2 × v/ r = m ev r\\\\niii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or\\\\nemitted when transition occurs between\\\\ntwo stationary states that differ in energy\\\\nby ∆ E , is given by:\\\\nν = =\\\\n\\\\nE −∆\\\\n\\\\nE E\\\\n\\\\nh\\\\n(^21) (2.10)\\\\nWhere E 1 and E 2 are the energies of the\\\\nlower and higher allowed energy states\\\\nrespectively. This expression is commonly\\\\nknown as Bohr’s frequency rule.\\\\niv) The angular momentum of an electron is\\\\nquantised. In a given stationary state it\\\\ncan be expressed as in equation (2.11)\\\\nm r n\\\\nh\\\\ne v =. 2 π^ n = 1,2,3..... (2.11)\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 47\\\\n\\\\nWhere m e is the mass of electron, v is the\\\\nvelocity and r is the radius of the orbit in which\\\\nelectron is moving.\\\\nThus an electron can move only in those\\\\norbits for which its angular momentum is\\\\nintegral multiple of h /2π. That means angular\\\\nmomentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted\\\\nor obsorbed only when transition of electron\\\\ntakes place from one quantised value of angular\\\\nmomentum to another. Therefore, Maxwell’s\\\\nelectromagnetic theory does not apply here that\\\\nis why only certain fixed orbits are allowed.\\\\nThe details regarding the derivation of\\\\nenergies of the stationary states used by Bohr,\\\\nare quite complicated and will be discussed in\\\\nhigher classes. However, according to Bohr’s\\\\ntheory for hydrogen atom:\\\\na) The stationary states for electron are\\\\nnumbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral\\\\nnumbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as\\\\nPrincipal quantum numbers.\\\\nb) The radii of the stationary states are\\\\nexpressed as:\\\\nr n = n^2 a 0 (2.12)\\\\nwhere a 0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of\\\\nthe first stationary state, called the Bohr\\\\norbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron\\\\nin the hydrogen atom is found in this orbit\\\\n(that is n =1). As n increases the value of r\\\\nwill increase. In other words the electron\\\\nwill be present away from the nucleus.\\\\nc) The most important property associated\\\\nwith the electron, is the energy of its\\\\nstationary state. It is given by the\\\\nexpression.\\\\nE\\\\nn H n\\\\n\\\\n= − \\\\uf8eb\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\n2 n = 1,2,3....

The energy of the lowest\\\\nstate, also called as the ground state, is\\\\n\\\\nE 1 = –2.18× 10 –18 (\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n12 ) = –2.18×^10\\\\n–18 J. The\\\\nenergy of the stationary state for n = 2, will\\\\nbe : E 2 = –2.18× 10 –18J (\\\\n\\\\n22 )= –0.545×^10\\\\n\\\\n–18 J.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different\\\\nstationary states or energy levels of hydrogen\\\\natom. This representation is called an energy\\\\nlevel diagram.\\\\nWhen the electron is free from the influence\\\\nof nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The\\\\nelectron in this situation is associated with the\\\\nstationary state of Principal Quantum number\\\\n= n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom.\\\\nWhen the electron is attracted by the nucleus\\\\nand is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted\\\\nWhat does the negative electronic\\\\nenergy ( En ) for hydrogen atom mean?\\\\nThe energy of the electron in a hydrogen\\\\natom has a negative sign for all possible\\\\norbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative\\\\nsign convey? This negative sign means that\\\\nthe energy of the electron in the atom is\\\\nlower than the energy of a free electron at\\\\nrest. A free electron at rest is an electron\\\\nthat is infinitely far away from the nucleus\\\\nand is assigned the energy value of zero.\\\\nMathematically, this corresponds to\\\\nsetting n equal to infinity in the equation\\\\n(2.13) so that E ∞=0. As the electron gets\\\\ncloser to the nucleus (as n decreases), En\\\\nbecomes larger in absolute value and more\\\\nand more negative.

His interest turned to\\\\nscience as a result of his\\\\nassignment to radio\\\\ncommunications in World WarI.\\\\nHe received his Dr. Sc. from the University of\\\\nParis in 1924. He was professor of theoretical\\\\nphysics at the University of Paris from 1932 untill\\\\nhis retirement in 1962.

The element helium (He) was\\\\ndiscovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.\\\\nLine Spectrum of Hydrogen\\\\nWhen an electric discharge is passed through\\\\ngaseous hydrogen, the H 2 molecules dissociate\\\\nand the energetically excited hydrogen atoms\\\\nproduced emit electromagnetic radiation of\\\\ndiscrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum\\\\nconsists of several series of lines named after\\\\ntheir discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on\\\\nthe basis of experimental observations that if\\\\n* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 45\\\\n\\\\nspectral lines are expressed in terms of\\\\nwavenumber ( ), then the visible lines of the\\\\nhydrogen spectrum obey the following formula:\\\\n\\\\n(2.8)\\\\n\\\\nwhere n is an integer equal to or greater than\\\\n3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....)\\\\nThe series of lines described by this formula\\\\nare called the Balmer series. The Balmer series\\\\nof lines are the only lines in the hydrogen\\\\nspectrum which appear in the visible region\\\\nof the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish\\\\nspectroscopist, Johannes Rydberg, noted that\\\\nall series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum\\\\ncould be described by the following\\\\nexpression :\\\\n\\\\n(2.9)\\\\n\\\\nwhere n 1 =1,2........\\\\n\\\\nn 2 = n 1 + 1, n 1 + 2......\\\\n\\\\nThe value 109,677 cm–1 is called the\\\\nRydberg constant for hydrogen.

There\\\\nare, however, certain features which are\\\\ncommon to all line spectra, i.e., (i) line spectrum\\\\nof element is unique and (ii) there is regularity\\\\nin the line spectrum of each element. The\\\\nquestions which arise are: What are the\\\\nreasons for these similarities? Is it something\\\\nto do with the electronic structure of atoms?\\\\nThese are the questions need to be answered.\\\\nWe shall find later that the answers to these\\\\nquestions provide the key in understanding\\\\nelectronic structure of these elements.\\\\n\\\\n2.4 Bohr’s Model for Hydrogen Atom\\\\n\\\\nNeils Bohr (1913) was the first to explain\\\\nquantitatively the general features of the\\\\nstructure of hydrogen atom and its spectrum.\\\\nHe used Planck’s concept of quantisation of\\\\nenergy. Though the theory is not the modern\\\\nquantum mechanics, it can still be used to\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.11 Transitions of the electron in the\\\\nhydrogen atom (The diagram shows\\\\nthe Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series\\\\nof transitions)\\\\nrationalize many points in the atomic structure\\\\nand spectra. Bohr’s model for hydrogen atom\\\\nis based on the following postulates:\\\\ni) The electron in the hydrogen atom can\\\\nmove around the nucleus in a circular path\\\\nof fixed radius and energy. These paths are\\\\ncalled orbits, stationary states or allowed\\\\nenergy states. These orbits are arranged\\\\nconcentrically around the nucleus.\\\\nii) The energy of an electron in the orbit does\\\\nnot change with time. However, the\\\\nelectron will move from a lower stationary\\\\nstate to a higher stationary state when\\\\nrequired amount of energy is absorbed\\\\nby the electron or energy is emitted when\\\\nelectron moves from higher stationary\\\\nstate to lower stationary state (equation\\\\n2.16). The energy change does not take\\\\nplace in a continuous manner.\\\\nAngular Momentum\\\\nJust as linear momentum is the product\\\\nof mass ( m ) and linear velocity (v), angular\\\\nmomentum is the product of moment of\\\\ninertia ( I ) and angular velocity (ω). For an\\\\nelectron of mass m e, moving in a circular\\\\npath of radius r around the nucleus,\\\\nangular momentum = I × ω\\\\nSince I = m er^2 , and ω = v/ r where v is the\\\\nlinear velocity,\\\\n∴angular momentum = m e r^2 × v/ r = m ev r\\\\niii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or\\\\nemitted when transition occurs between\\\\ntwo stationary states that differ in energy\\\\nby ∆ E , is given by:\\\\nν = =\\\\n\\\\nE −∆\\\\n\\\\nE E\\\\n\\\\nh\\\\n(^21) (2.10)\\\\nWhere E 1 and E 2 are the energies of the\\\\nlower and higher allowed energy states\\\\nrespectively. This expression is commonly\\\\nknown as Bohr’s frequency rule.\\\\niv) The angular momentum of an electron is\\\\nquantised. In a given stationary state it\\\\ncan be expressed as in equation (2.11)\\\\nm r n\\\\nh\\\\ne v =. 2 π^ n = 1,2,3..... (2.11)\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 47\\\\n\\\\nWhere m e is the mass of electron, v is the\\\\nvelocity and r is the radius of the orbit in which\\\\nelectron is moving.\\\\nThus an electron can move only in those\\\\norbits for which its angular momentum is\\\\nintegral multiple of h /2π. That means angular\\\\nmomentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted\\\\nor obsorbed only when transition of electron\\\\ntakes place from one quantised value of angular\\\\nmomentum to another. Therefore, Maxwell’s\\\\nelectromagnetic theory does not apply here that\\\\nis why only certain fixed orbits are allowed.\\\\nThe details regarding the derivation of\\\\nenergies of the stationary states used by Bohr,\\\\nare quite complicated and will be discussed in\\\\nhigher classes. However, according to Bohr’s\\\\ntheory for hydrogen atom:\\\\na) The stationary states for electron are\\\\nnumbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral\\\\nnumbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as\\\\nPrincipal quantum numbers.\\\\nb) The radii of the stationary states are\\\\nexpressed as:\\\\nr n = n^2 a 0 (2.12)\\\\nwhere a 0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of\\\\nthe first stationary state, called the Bohr\\\\norbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron\\\\nin the hydrogen atom is found in this orbit\\\\n(that is n =1). As n increases the value of r\\\\nwill increase. In other words the electron\\\\nwill be present away from the nucleus.\\\\nc) The most important property associated\\\\nwith the electron, is the energy of its\\\\nstationary state. It is given by the\\\\nexpression.\\\\nE\\\\nn H n\\\\n\\\\n= − \\\\uf8eb\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\n2 n = 1,2,3.... (2.13)\\\\nwhere RH is called Rydberg constant and its\\\\nvalue is 2.18× 10 –18 J. The energy of the lowest\\\\nstate, also called as the ground state, is\\\\n\\\\nE 1 = –2.18× 10 –18 (\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n12 ) = –2.18×^10\\\\n–18 J. The\\\\nenergy of the stationary state for n = 2, will\\\\nbe : E 2 = –2.18× 10 –18J (\\\\n\\\\n22 )= –0.545×^10\\\\n\\\\n–18 J.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different\\\\nstationary states or energy levels of hydrogen\\\\natom. This representation is called an energy\\\\nlevel diagram.\\\\nWhen the electron is free from the influence\\\\nof nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The\\\\nelectron in this situation is associated with the\\\\nstationary state of Principal Quantum number\\\\n= n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom.\\\\nWhen the electron is attracted by the nucleus\\\\nand is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted\\\\nWhat does the negative electronic\\\\nenergy ( En ) for hydrogen atom mean?\\\\nThe energy of the electron in a hydrogen\\\\natom has a negative sign for all possible\\\\norbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative\\\\nsign convey? This negative sign means that\\\\nthe energy of the electron in the atom is\\\\nlower than the energy of a free electron at\\\\nrest. A free electron at rest is an electron\\\\nthat is infinitely far away from the nucleus\\\\nand is assigned the energy value of zero.\\\\nMathematically, this corresponds to\\\\nsetting n equal to infinity in the equation\\\\n(2.13) so that E ∞=0. As the electron gets\\\\ncloser to the nucleus (as n decreases), En\\\\nbecomes larger in absolute value and more\\\\nand more negative. The most negative\\\\nenergy value is given by n =1 which\\\\ncorresponds to the most stable orbit. We\\\\ncall this the ground state.\\\\nNiels Bohr\\\\n(1885–1962)\\\\nNiels Bohr, a Danish\\\\nphysicist received his Ph.D.\\\\nfrom the University of\\\\nCopenhagen in 1911.

Analogously, in order to determine\\\\nthe position of an electron, we must use a\\\\nmeterstick calibrated in units of smaller than\\\\nthe dimensions of electron (keep in mind that\\\\nan electron is considered as a point charge and\\\\nis therefore, dimensionless). To observe an\\\\nelectron, we can illuminate it with “light” or\\\\nelectromagnetic radiation. The “light” used\\\\nmust have a wavelength smaller than the\\\\ndimensions of an electron. The high\\\\n\\\\nmomentum photons of such light p\\\\nh\\\\n=\\\\nλ\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\nwould change the energy of electrons by\\\\ncollisions. In this process we, no doubt, would\\\\nbe able to calculate the position of the electron,\\\\nbut we would know very little about the\\\\nvelocity of the electron after the collision.\\\\nSignificance of Uncertainty Principle\\\\nOne of the important implications of the\\\\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it\\\\nrules out existence of definite paths or\\\\ntrajectories of electrons and other similar\\\\nparticles. The trajectory of an object is\\\\ndetermined by its location and velocity at\\\\nvarious moments. If we know where a body is\\\\nat a particular instant and if we also know its\\\\nvelocity and the forces acting on it at that\\\\ninstant, we can tell where the body would be\\\\nsometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the\\\\nposition of an object and its velocity fix its\\\\ntrajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such\\\\nas an electron, it is not possible simultaneously\\\\nto determine the position and velocity at any\\\\ngiven instant to an arbitrary degree of\\\\nprecision, it is not possible to talk of the\\\\ntrajectory of an electron.\\\\nThe effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty\\\\nPrinciple is significant only for motion of\\\\nmicroscopic objects and is negligible for\\\\nthat of macroscopic objects. This can be\\\\nseen from the following examples.\\\\nIf uncertainty principle is applied to an\\\\nobject of mass, say about a milligram (10–6 kg),\\\\nthen\\\\nWerner Heisenberg (1901– 1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901– 1976) received his Ph.D. in\\\\nphysics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max\\\\nBorn at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of\\\\nphysics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg\\\\nwas in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named\\\\ndirector of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished\\\\nmountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932.\\\\n\\\\n52 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nThe value of ∆v∆x obtained is extremely\\\\nsmall and is insignificant. Therefore, one may\\\\nsay that in dealing with milligram-sized or\\\\nheavier objects, the associated\\\\nuncertainties are hardly of any real\\\\nconsequence.\\\\nIn the case of a microscopic object like an\\\\nelectron on the other hand. ∆v.∆x obtained is\\\\nmuch larger and such uncertainties are of real\\\\nconsequence. For example, for an electron\\\\nwhose mass is 9.11×10–31 kg., according to\\\\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle\\\\n\\\\nIt, therefore, means that if one tries to find\\\\nthe exact location of the electron, say to an\\\\nuncertainty of only 10–8 m, then the uncertainty\\\\n∆v in velocity would be\\\\n\\\\n10 m s\\\\nwhich is so large that the classical picture of\\\\nelectrons moving in Bohr’s orbits (fixed) cannot\\\\nhold good. It, therefore, means that the\\\\nprecise statements of the position and\\\\nmomentum of electrons have to be\\\\nreplaced by the statements of probability,\\\\nthat the electron has at a given position\\\\nand momentum.

You\\\\nwill learn its solutions for different systems in\\\\nhigher classes.\\\\nFor a system (such as an atom or a\\\\nmolecule whose energy does not change with\\\\ntime) the Schrödinger equation is written as\\\\nwhere is a mathematical operator\\\\ncalled Hamiltonian. Schrödinger gave a recipe\\\\nof constructing this operator from the\\\\nexpression for the total energy of the system.\\\\nThe total energy of the system takes into\\\\naccount the kinetic energies of all the sub-\\\\natomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive\\\\npotential between the electrons and nuclei and\\\\nrepulsive potential among the electrons and\\\\nnuclei individually.

Each sub-shell is assigned an\\\\nazimuthal quantum number ( l ). Sub-shells\\\\ncorresponding to different values of l are\\\\nrepresented by the following symbols.\\\\nValue for l : 0 1 2 3 4 5 ............\\\\nnotation for s p d f g h ............\\\\nsub-shell\\\\nTable 2.4 shows the permissible values of\\\\n‘ l ’ for a given principal quantum number and\\\\nthe corresponding sub-shell notation.\\\\nTable 2.4 Subshell Notations\\\\nMagnetic orbital quantum number. ‘ ml ’\\\\ngives information about the spatial\\\\norientation of the orbital with respect to\\\\nstandard set of co-ordinate axis.

It should be noted\\\\n\\\\n56 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nthat the values of ml are derived from l and that\\\\nthe value of l are derived from n.\\\\n\\\\nelectron has, besides charge and mass,\\\\nintrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin\\\\nangular momentum of the electron — a vector\\\\nquantity, can have two orientations relative to\\\\nthe chosen axis. These two orientations are\\\\ndistinguished by the spin quantum numbers\\\\nm s which can take the values of +½ or –½.\\\\nThese are called the two spin states of the\\\\nelectron and are normally represented by two\\\\narrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two\\\\nelectrons that have different m s values (one +½\\\\nand the other –½) are said to have opposite\\\\nspins. An orbital cannot hold more than two\\\\nelectrons and these two electrons should have\\\\nopposite spins.\\\\nTo sum up, the four quantum numbers\\\\nprovide the following information :\\\\ni) n defines the shell, determines the size of\\\\nthe orbital and also to a large extent the\\\\nenergy of the orbital.\\\\nii) There are n subshells in the n th shell. l\\\\nidentifies the subshell and determines the\\\\nshape of the orbital (see section 2.6.2).\\\\nThere are (2 l +1) orbitals of each type in a\\\\nsubshell, that is, one s orbital ( l = 0), three\\\\np orbitals ( l = 1) and five d orbitals ( l = 2)\\\\nper subshell.

An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path\\\\naround the nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the\\\\nelectron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore,\\\\nhave no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An\\\\natomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one\\\\nelectron wave function ψ in an atom. It is characterized by three quantum numbers ( n, l and\\\\nml ) and its value depends upon the coordinates of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical\\\\nmeaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|^2 which has a physical meaning. |ψ|^2\\\\nat any point in an atom gives the value of probability density at that point. Probability density\\\\n(|ψ|^2 ) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|^2 and a small volume (called a\\\\nvolume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that volume (the reason for\\\\nspecifying a small volume element is that |ψ|^2 varies from one region to another in space but\\\\nits value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). The total probability\\\\nof finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum of all the products\\\\nof |ψ|^2 and the corresponding volume elements.

An orbital cannot hold more than two\\\\nelectrons and these two electrons should have\\\\nopposite spins.\\\\nTo sum up, the four quantum numbers\\\\nprovide the following information :\\\\ni) n defines the shell, determines the size of\\\\nthe orbital and also to a large extent the\\\\nenergy of the orbital.\\\\nii) There are n subshells in the n th shell. l\\\\nidentifies the subshell and determines the\\\\nshape of the orbital (see section 2.6.2).\\\\nThere are (2 l +1) orbitals of each type in a\\\\nsubshell, that is, one s orbital ( l = 0), three\\\\np orbitals ( l = 1) and five d orbitals ( l = 2)\\\\nper subshell. To some extent l also\\\\ndetermines the energy of the orbital in a\\\\nmulti-electron atom.\\\\niii) ml designates the orientation of the orbital.\\\\nFor a given value of l , ml has (2 l +1) values,\\\\nOrbit, orbital and its importance\\\\nOrbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path\\\\naround the nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the\\\\nelectron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore,\\\\nhave no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An\\\\natomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one\\\\nelectron wave function ψ in an atom. It is characterized by three quantum numbers ( n, l and\\\\nml ) and its value depends upon the coordinates of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical\\\\nmeaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|^2 which has a physical meaning. |ψ|^2\\\\nat any point in an atom gives the value of probability density at that point. Probability density\\\\n(|ψ|^2 ) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|^2 and a small volume (called a\\\\nvolume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that volume (the reason for\\\\nspecifying a small volume element is that |ψ|^2 varies from one region to another in space but\\\\nits value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). The total probability\\\\nof finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum of all the products\\\\nof |ψ|^2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the probable\\\\ndistribution of an electron in an orbital.\\\\nValue of l 0 1 2 3 4 5\\\\nSubshell notation s p d f g h\\\\nnumber of orbitals 1 3 5 7 9 11\\\\nElectron spin ‘s’ : The three quantum\\\\nnumbers labelling an atomic orbital can be\\\\nused equally well to define its energy, shape\\\\nand orientation.

The variation of\\\\nψ^2 as a function of r for 1 s and 2 s orbitals is\\\\ngiven in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may note\\\\nthat the curves for 1 s and 2 s orbitals are\\\\ndifferent.\\\\nIt may be noted that for 1 s orbital the\\\\nprobability density is maximum at the nucleus\\\\nand it decreases sharply as we move away from\\\\nit.

In this representation, a boundary\\\\nsurface or contour surface is drawn in space\\\\nfor an orbital on which the value of probability\\\\ndensity |ψ|^2 is constant. In principle many\\\\nsuch boundary surfaces may be possible.\\\\nHowever, for a given orbital, only that\\\\nboundary surface diagram of constant\\\\nprobability density* is taken to be good\\\\nrepresentation of the shape of the orbital which\\\\nencloses a region or volume in which the\\\\nprobability of finding the electron is very high,\\\\nsay, 90%. The boundary surface diagram for\\\\n1 s and 2 s orbitals are given in Fig. 2.13(b).\\\\nOne may ask a question : Why do we not draw\\\\na boundary surface diagram, which bounds a\\\\nregion in which the probability of finding the\\\\nelectron is, 100 %? The answer to this question\\\\nis that the probability density |ψ|^2 has always\\\\nsome value, howsoever small it may be, at any\\\\nfinite distance from the nucleus. It is therefore,\\\\nnot possible to draw a boundary surface\\\\ndiagram of a rigid size in which the probability\\\\nof finding the electron is 100%.

For our\\\\npurpose, it is sufficient to remember that,\\\\nbecause there are three possible values of ml ,\\\\n\\\\n60 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nnumber. Thus the energy of the orbitals in\\\\nhydrogen atom increases as follows :\\\\n\\\\nThe energy of an electron in a multi-\\\\nelectron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen\\\\natom, depends not only on its principal\\\\nquantum number (shell), but also on its\\\\nazimuthal quantum number (subshell). That\\\\nis, for a given principal quantum number, s ,\\\\np , d , f ... all have different energies. Within a\\\\ngiven principal quantum number, the energy\\\\nof orbitals increases in the order s < p < d < f. For\\\\nhigher energy levels, these differences are\\\\nsufficiently pronounced and straggering of\\\\norbital energy may result, e.g., 4 s <3 d and\\\\n6 s <5 d ; 4 f <6 p. The main reason for having\\\\ndifferent energies of the subshells is the mutual\\\\nrepulsion among the electrons in multi-\\\\nelectron atoms. The only electrical interaction\\\\npresent in hydrogen atom is the attraction\\\\nbetween the negatively charged electron and\\\\nthe positively charged nucleus. In multi-\\\\nelectron atoms, besides the presence of\\\\nattraction between the electron and nucleus,\\\\nthere are repulsion terms between every\\\\nelectron and other electrons present in the\\\\natom. Thus the stability of an electron in a\\\\nmulti-electron atom is because total attractive\\\\ninteractions are more than the repulsive\\\\ninteractions. In general, the repulsive\\\\ninteraction of the electrons in the outer shell\\\\nwith the electrons in the inner shell are more\\\\nimportant. On the other hand, the attractive\\\\ninteractions of an electron increases with\\\\nincrease of positive charge ( Ze ) on the nucleus.\\\\nDue to the presence of electrons in the inner\\\\nshells, the electron in the outer shell will not\\\\nexperience the full positive charge of the\\\\nnucleus ( Ze ). The effect will be lowered due to\\\\nthe partial screening of positive charge on the\\\\nnucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is\\\\nknown as the shielding of the outer shell\\\\nelectrons from the nucleus by the inner\\\\nshell electrons, and the net positive charge\\\\nexperienced by the outer electrons is known\\\\nas effective nuclear charge ( Z eff e ). Despite\\\\nthe shielding of the outer electrons from the\\\\nnucleus by the inner shell electrons, the\\\\nattractive force experienced by the outer shell\\\\nelectrons increases with increase of nuclear\\\\ncharge. In other words, the energy of\\\\ninteraction between, the nucleus and electron\\\\nFig. 2.16 Energy level diagrams for the few\\\\nelectronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom\\\\nand (b) multi-electronic atoms.

Lastly it may be mentioned\\\\nhere that energies of the orbitals in the\\\\nsame subshell decrease with increase in\\\\nthe atomic number ( Z eff). For example, energy\\\\nof 2 s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than\\\\nthat of 2 s orbital of lithium and that of lithium\\\\nis greater than that of sodium and so on, that\\\\nis, E 2 s (H) > E 2 s (Li) > E 2 s (Na) > E 2 s (K).\\\\n2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in Atom\\\\nThe filling of electrons into the orbitals of\\\\ndifferent atoms takes place according to the\\\\naufbau principle which is based on the Pauli’s\\\\nexclusion principle, the Hund’s rule of\\\\nmaximum multiplicity and the relative\\\\nenergies of the orbitals.\\\\nAufbau Principle\\\\nThe word ‘ aufbau ’ in German means ‘building\\\\nup’. The building up of orbitals means the\\\\nTable 2.5 Arrangement of Orbitals with\\\\nIncreasing Energy on the Basis of\\\\n( n+l ) Rule\\\\n\\\\n62 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nfilling up of orbitals with electrons. The\\\\nprinciple states : In the ground state of the\\\\natoms, the orbitals are filled in order of\\\\ntheir increasing energies. In other words,\\\\nelectrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital\\\\navailable to them and enter into higher energy\\\\norbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are\\\\nfilled. As you have learnt above, energy of a\\\\ngiven orbital depends upon effective nuclear\\\\ncharge and different type of orbitals are affected\\\\nto different extent. Thus, there is no single\\\\nordering of energies of orbitals which will be\\\\nuniversally correct for all atoms.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, following order of energies of the\\\\norbitals is extremely useful:\\\\n\\\\nThe order may be remembered by using\\\\nthe method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from\\\\n\\\\nthe top, the direction of the arrows gives the\\\\norder of filling of orbitals, that is starting from\\\\nright top to bottom left. With respect to\\\\nplacement of outermost valence electrons, it is\\\\nremarkably accurate for all atoms. For\\\\nexample, valence electron in potassium must\\\\nchoose between 3 d and 4 s orbitals and as\\\\npredicted by this sequence, it is found in 4 s\\\\norbital. The above order should be assumed\\\\nto be a rough guide to the filling of energy\\\\nlevels. In many cases, the orbitals are similar\\\\nin energy and small changes in atomic\\\\nstructure may bring about a change in the\\\\norder of filling. Even then, the above series is a\\\\nuseful guide to the building of the electronic\\\\nstructure of an atom provided that it is\\\\nremembered that exceptions may occur.\\\\nPauli Exclusion Principle\\\\nThe number of electrons to be filled in various\\\\norbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle,\\\\ngiven by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli\\\\n(1926). According to this principle : No two\\\\nelectrons in an atom can have the same\\\\nset of four quantum numbers. Pauli\\\\nexclusion principle can also be stated as : “Only\\\\ntwo electrons may exist in the same orbital\\\\nand these electrons must have opposite\\\\nspin.” This means that the two electrons can\\\\nhave the same value of three quantum numbers\\\\nn , l and ml , but must have the opposite spin\\\\nquantum number. The restriction imposed by\\\\nPauli’s exclusion principle on the number of\\\\nelectrons in an orbital helps in calculating the\\\\ncapacity of electrons to be present in any\\\\nsubshell. For example, subshell 1 s comprises\\\\none orbital and thus the maximum number of\\\\nelectrons present in 1 s subshell can be two, in\\\\np and d subshells, the maximum number of\\\\nelectrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can\\\\nbe summed up as : the maximum number\\\\nof electrons in the shell with principal\\\\nquantum number n is equal to 2 n^2.\\\\nHund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity\\\\nThis rule deals with the filling of electrons into\\\\nthe orbitals belonging to the same subshell\\\\nFig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitals (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 63\\\\n\\\\ndegenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of\\\\nelectrons in the orbitals belonging to the\\\\nsame subshell ( p , d or f ) does not take place\\\\nuntil each orbital belonging to that\\\\nsubshell has got one electron each i.e., it\\\\nis singly occupied.\\\\n\\\\n2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of Atoms\\\\n\\\\nThe distribution of electrons into orbitals of an\\\\natom is called its electronic configuration.\\\\nIf one keeps in mind the basic rules which\\\\ngovern the filling of different atomic orbitals,\\\\nthe electronic configurations of different atoms\\\\ncan be written very easily.\\\\n\\\\nThe electronic configuration of different\\\\natoms can be represented in two ways. For\\\\nexample :\\\\n\\\\n(i) s a p b d c ...... notation\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Orbital diagram\\\\n\\\\ns p d\\\\n\\\\nIn the first notation, the subshell is\\\\nrepresented by the respective letter symbol and\\\\nthe number of electrons present in the subshell\\\\nis depicted, as the super script, like a, b, c, ...\\\\netc. The similar subshell represented for\\\\ndifferent shells is differentiated by writing the\\\\nprincipal quantum number before the\\\\nrespective subshell. In the second notation\\\\neach orbital of the subshell is represented by\\\\na box and the electron is represented by an\\\\narrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓) a\\\\nnegative spin. The advantage of second notation\\\\nover the first is that it represents all the four\\\\nquantum numbers.\\\\n\\\\nThe hydrogen atom has only one electron\\\\nwhich goes in the orbital with the lowest\\\\nenergy, namely 1 s. The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of the hydrogen atom is 1 s^1\\\\nmeaning that it has one electron in the 1 s\\\\norbital. The second electron in helium (He) can\\\\n\\\\nalso occupy the 1 s orbital. Its configuration\\\\nis, therefore, 1 s^2. As mentioned above, the two\\\\nelectrons differ from each other with opposite\\\\nspin, as can be seen from the orbital diagram.\\\\nThe third electron of lithium (Li) is not\\\\nallowed in the 1 s orbital because of Pauli\\\\nexclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the next\\\\navailable choice, namely the 2 s orbital. The\\\\nelectronic configuration of Li is 1 s^22 s^1. The 2 s\\\\norbital can accommodate one more electron.\\\\nThe configuration of beryllium (Be) atom is,\\\\ntherefore, 1 s^2 2 s^2 (see Table 2.6, page 66 for\\\\nthe electronic configurations of elements).\\\\nIn the next six elements—boron\\\\n(B, 1 s^22 s^22 p^1 ), carbon (C, 1 s^22 s^22 p^2 ), nitrogen\\\\n(N, 1 s^22 s^22 p^3 ), oxygen (O, 1 s^22 s^22 p^4 ), fluorine\\\\n(F, 1 s^22 s^22 p^5 ) and neon (Ne, 1 s^22 s^22 p^6 ), the 2 p\\\\norbitals get progressively filled. This process\\\\nis completed with the neon atom. The orbital\\\\npicture of these elements can be represented\\\\nas follows :\\\\nThe electronic configuration of the elements\\\\nsodium (Na,1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^1 ) to argon\\\\n(Ar,1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^6 ), follow exactly the same\\\\npattern as the elements from lithium to neon\\\\nwith the difference that the 3 s and 3 p orbitals\\\\nare getting filled now. This process can be\\\\nsimplified if we represent the total number of\\\\nelectrons in the first two shells by the name of\\\\nelement neon (Ne). The electronic configuration\\\\n\\\\n64 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nof the elements from sodium to argon can be\\\\nwritten as (Na, [Ne]3 s^1 ) to (Ar, [Ne] 3 s^23 p^6 ). The\\\\nelectrons in the completely filled shells are\\\\nknown as core electrons and the electrons that\\\\nare added to the electronic shell with the\\\\nhighest principal quantum number are called\\\\nvalence electrons. For example, the electrons\\\\nin Ne are the core electrons and the electrons\\\\nfrom Na to Ar are the valence electrons. In\\\\npotassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4 s orbital,\\\\nbeing lower in energy than the 3 d orbitals, is\\\\noccupied by one and two electrons respectively.\\\\n\\\\nfilling of 6 p , then 7 s and finally 5 f and 6 d\\\\norbitals takes place. The elements after\\\\nuranium (U) are all short-lived and all of them\\\\nare produced artificially. The electronic\\\\nconfigurations of the known elements (as\\\\ndetermined by spectroscopic methods) are\\\\ntabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66).\\\\nOne may ask what is the utility of knowing\\\\nthe electron configuration? The modern\\\\napproach to the chemistry, infact, depends\\\\nalmost entirely on electronic distribution to\\\\nunderstand and explain chemical behaviour.\\\\nFor example, questions like why two or more\\\\natoms combine to form molecules, why some\\\\nelements are metals while others are non-\\\\nmetals, why elements like helium and argon\\\\nare not reactive but elements like the halogens\\\\nare reactive, find simple explanation from the\\\\nelectronic configuration. These questions have\\\\nno answer in the Daltonian model of atom. A\\\\ndetailed understanding of the electronic\\\\nstructure of atom is, therefore, very essential\\\\nfor getting an insight into the various aspects\\\\nof modern chemical knowledge.\\\\n2.6.6 Stability of Completely Filled and\\\\nHalf Filled Subshells\\\\nThe ground state electronic configuration of the\\\\natom of an element always corresponds to the\\\\nstate of the lowest total electronic energy. The\\\\nelectronic configurations of most of the atoms\\\\nfollow the basic rules given in Section 2.6.5.\\\\nHowever, in certain elements such as Cu, or\\\\nCr, where the two subshells (4 s and 3 d ) differ\\\\nslightly in their energies, an electron shifts from\\\\na subshell of lower energy (4 s ) to a subshell of\\\\nhigher energy (3 d ), provided such a shift\\\\nresults in all orbitals of the subshell of higher\\\\nenergy getting either completely filled or half\\\\nfilled. The valence electronic configurations of\\\\nCr and Cu, therefore, are 3 d^5 4 s^1 and 3 d^10 4 s^1\\\\nrespectively and not 3 d^4 4 s^2 and 3 d^9 4 s^2. It has\\\\nbeen found that there is extra stability\\\\nassociated with these electronic configurations.\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 65\\\\n\\\\nThe completely filled and completely\\\\nhalf-filled subshells are stable due to\\\\nthe following reasons:\\\\n1.Symmetrical distribution of\\\\nelectrons: It is well known that symmetry\\\\nleads to stability. The completely filled or\\\\nhalf filled subshells have symmetrical\\\\ndistribution of electrons in them and are\\\\ntherefore more stable. Electrons in the\\\\nsame subshell (here 3d ) have equal energy\\\\nbut different spatial distribution.\\\\nConsequently, their shielding of one-\\\\nanother is relatively small and the\\\\nelectrons are more strongly attracted by\\\\nthe nucleus.\\\\n2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing\\\\neffect arises whenever two or more\\\\nelectrons with the same spin are present\\\\nin the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.\\\\nThese electrons tend to exchange their\\\\npositions and the energy released due to\\\\nthis exchange is called exchange energy.\\\\nThe number of exchanges that can take\\\\nplace is maximum when the subshell is\\\\neither half filled or completely filled (Fig.\\\\n2.18). As a result the exchange energy is\\\\nmaximum and so is the stability.\\\\n    You may note that the exchange\\\\nenergy is at the basis of Hund’s rule that\\\\nelectrons which enter orbitals of equal\\\\nenergy have parallel spins as far as\\\\npossible. In other words, the extra\\\\nstability of half-filled and completely filled\\\\nsubshell is due to: (i) relatively small\\\\nshielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion\\\\nenergy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.\\\\nDetails about the exchange energy will be\\\\ndealt with in higher classes.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.18 Possible exchange for a d^5\\\\nconfiguration\\\\nCauses of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells\\\\n\\\\n66 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nTable 2.6 Electronic Configurations of the Elements\\\\n* Elements with exceptional electronic configurations\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 67\\\\n\\\\n** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.\\\\n\\\\n68 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nSUMMARY\\\\nAtoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element\\\\nthat chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded\\\\natom as the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth\\\\ncentury, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three\\\\nfundamental particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic\\\\nparticles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\\\\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity\\\\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be\\\\nevenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle\\\\nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively\\\\ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits.\\\\nRutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over\\\\nThomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron\\\\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of\\\\natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus.\\\\nThe difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model\\\\nof the hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular\\\\norbits. Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr\\\\ncalculated the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance\\\\nbetween the electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for\\\\nexplaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron\\\\natoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as\\\\na charged particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave\\\\ncharacter of the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory.', 'boundary\\\\nsurface or contour surface is drawn in space\\\\nfor an orbital on which the value of probability\\\\ndensity |ψ|^2 is constant. In principle many\\\\nsuch boundary surfaces may be possible.\\\\nHowever, for a given orbital, only that\\\\nboundary surface diagram of constant\\\\nprobability density* is taken to be good\\\\nrepresentation of the shape of the orbital which\\\\nencloses a region or volume in which the\\\\nprobability of finding the electron is very high,\\\\nsay, 90%. The boundary surface diagram for\\\\n1 s and 2 s orbitals are given in Fig. 2.13(b).\\\\nOne may ask a question : Why do we not draw\\\\na boundary surface diagram, which bounds a\\\\nregion in which the probability of finding the\\\\nelectron is, 100 %? The answer to this question\\\\nis that the probability density |ψ|^2 has always\\\\nsome value, howsoever small it may be, at any\\\\nfinite distance from the nucleus. It is therefore,\\\\nnot possible to draw a boundary surface\\\\ndiagram of a rigid size in which the probability\\\\nof finding the electron is 100%. Boundary\\\\nsurface diagram for a s orbital is actually a\\\\nsphere centred on the nucleus. In two\\\\ndimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It\\\\nencloses a region in which probability of\\\\nfinding the electron is about 90%.\\\\n\\\\nBoundary surface diagrams for three 2 p\\\\norbitals ( l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these\\\\ndiagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. Here,\\\\nunlike s -orbitals, the boundary surface\\\\n\\\\ndiagrams are not spherical. Instead each\\\\np orbital consists of two sections called lobes\\\\nthat are on either side of the plane that passes\\\\nthrough the nucleus.

In other words, the energy of\\\\ninteraction between, the nucleus and electron\\\\nFig. 2.16 Energy level diagrams for the few\\\\nelectronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom\\\\nand (b) multi-electronic atoms.

Lastly it may be mentioned\\\\nhere that energies of the orbitals in the\\\\nsame subshell decrease with increase in\\\\nthe atomic number ( Z eff). For example, energy\\\\nof 2 s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than\\\\nthat of 2 s orbital of lithium and that of lithium\\\\nis greater than that of sodium and so on, that\\\\nis, E 2 s (H) > E 2 s (Li) > E 2 s (Na) > E 2 s (K).\\\\n2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in Atom\\\\nThe filling of electrons into the orbitals of\\\\ndifferent atoms takes place according to the\\\\naufbau principle which is based on the Pauli’s\\\\nexclusion principle, the Hund’s rule of\\\\nmaximum multiplicity and the relative\\\\nenergies of the orbitals.\\\\nAufbau Principle\\\\nThe word ‘ aufbau ’ in German means ‘building\\\\nup’. The building up of orbitals means the\\\\nTable 2.5 Arrangement of Orbitals with\\\\nIncreasing Energy on the Basis of\\\\n( n+l ) Rule\\\\n\\\\n62 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nfilling up of orbitals with electrons. The\\\\nprinciple states : In the ground state of the\\\\natoms, the orbitals are filled in order of\\\\ntheir increasing energies. In other words,\\\\nelectrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital\\\\navailable to them and enter into higher energy\\\\norbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are\\\\nfilled. As you have learnt above, energy of a\\\\ngiven orbital depends upon effective nuclear\\\\ncharge and different type of orbitals are affected\\\\nto different extent. Thus, there is no single\\\\nordering of energies of orbitals which will be\\\\nuniversally correct for all atoms.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, following order of energies of the\\\\norbitals is extremely useful:\\\\n\\\\nThe order may be remembered by using\\\\nthe method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from\\\\n\\\\nthe top, the direction of the arrows gives the\\\\norder of filling of orbitals, that is starting from\\\\nright top to bottom left. With respect to\\\\nplacement of outermost valence electrons, it is\\\\nremarkably accurate for all atoms. For\\\\nexample, valence electron in potassium must\\\\nchoose between 3 d and 4 s orbitals and as\\\\npredicted by this sequence, it is found in 4 s\\\\norbital. The above order should be assumed\\\\nto be a rough guide to the filling of energy\\\\nlevels. In many cases, the orbitals are similar\\\\nin energy and small changes in atomic\\\\nstructure may bring about a change in the\\\\norder of filling. Even then, the above series is a\\\\nuseful guide to the building of the electronic\\\\nstructure of an atom provided that it is\\\\nremembered that exceptions may occur.\\\\nPauli Exclusion Principle\\\\nThe number of electrons to be filled in various\\\\norbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle,\\\\ngiven by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli\\\\n(1926). According to this principle : No two\\\\nelectrons in an atom can have the same\\\\nset of four quantum numbers. Pauli\\\\nexclusion principle can also be stated as : “Only\\\\ntwo electrons may exist in the same orbital\\\\nand these electrons must have opposite\\\\nspin.” This means that the two electrons can\\\\nhave the same value of three quantum numbers\\\\nn , l and ml , but must have the opposite spin\\\\nquantum number. The restriction imposed by\\\\nPauli’s exclusion principle on the number of\\\\nelectrons in an orbital helps in calculating the\\\\ncapacity of electrons to be present in any\\\\nsubshell. For example, subshell 1 s comprises\\\\none orbital and thus the maximum number of\\\\nelectrons present in 1 s subshell can be two, in\\\\np and d subshells, the maximum number of\\\\nelectrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can\\\\nbe summed up as : the maximum number\\\\nof electrons in the shell with principal\\\\nquantum number n is equal to 2 n^2.\\\\nHund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity\\\\nThis rule deals with the filling of electrons into\\\\nthe orbitals belonging to the same subshell\\\\nFig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitals (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 63\\\\n\\\\ndegenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of\\\\nelectrons in the orbitals belonging to the\\\\nsame subshell ( p , d or f ) does not take place\\\\nuntil each orbital belonging to that\\\\nsubshell has got one electron each i.e., it\\\\nis singly occupied.\\\\n\\\\n2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of Atoms\\\\n\\\\nThe distribution of electrons into orbitals of an\\\\natom is called its electronic configuration.\\\\nIf one keeps in mind the basic rules which\\\\ngovern the filling of different atomic orbitals,\\\\nthe electronic configurations of different atoms\\\\ncan be written very easily.\\\\n\\\\nThe electronic configuration of different\\\\natoms can be represented in two ways. For\\\\nexample :\\\\n\\\\n(i) s a p b d c ...... notation\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Orbital diagram\\\\n\\\\ns p d\\\\n\\\\nIn the first notation, the subshell is\\\\nrepresented by the respective letter symbol and\\\\nthe number of electrons present in the subshell\\\\nis depicted, as the super script, like a, b, c, ...\\\\netc. The similar subshell represented for\\\\ndifferent shells is differentiated by writing the\\\\nprincipal quantum number before the\\\\nrespective subshell. In the second notation\\\\neach orbital of the subshell is represented by\\\\na box and the electron is represented by an\\\\narrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓) a\\\\nnegative spin. The advantage of second notation\\\\nover the first is that it represents all the four\\\\nquantum numbers.\\\\n\\\\nThe hydrogen atom has only one electron\\\\nwhich goes in the orbital with the lowest\\\\nenergy, namely 1 s. The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of the hydrogen atom is 1 s^1\\\\nmeaning that it has one electron in the 1 s\\\\norbital. The second electron in helium (He) can\\\\n\\\\nalso occupy the 1 s orbital. Its configuration\\\\nis, therefore, 1 s^2. As mentioned above, the two\\\\nelectrons differ from each other with opposite\\\\nspin, as can be seen from the orbital diagram.\\\\nThe third electron of lithium (Li) is not\\\\nallowed in the 1 s orbital because of Pauli\\\\nexclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the next\\\\navailable choice, namely the 2 s orbital. The\\\\nelectronic configuration of Li is 1 s^22 s^1. The 2 s\\\\norbital can accommodate one more electron.\\\\nThe configuration of beryllium (Be) atom is,\\\\ntherefore, 1 s^2 2 s^2 (see Table 2.6, page 66 for\\\\nthe electronic configurations of elements).\\\\nIn the next six elements—boron\\\\n(B, 1 s^22 s^22 p^1 ), carbon (C, 1 s^22 s^22 p^2 ), nitrogen\\\\n(N, 1 s^22 s^22 p^3 ), oxygen (O, 1 s^22 s^22 p^4 ), fluorine\\\\n(F, 1 s^22 s^22 p^5 ) and neon (Ne, 1 s^22 s^22 p^6 ), the 2 p\\\\norbitals get progressively filled. This process\\\\nis completed with the neon atom. The orbital\\\\npicture of these elements can be represented\\\\nas follows :\\\\nThe electronic configuration of the elements\\\\nsodium (Na,1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^1 ) to argon\\\\n(Ar,1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^6 ), follow exactly the same\\\\npattern as the elements from lithium to neon\\\\nwith the difference that the 3 s and 3 p orbitals\\\\nare getting filled now. This process can be\\\\nsimplified if we represent the total number of\\\\nelectrons in the first two shells by the name of\\\\nelement neon (Ne). The electronic configuration\\\\n\\\\n64 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nof the elements from sodium to argon can be\\\\nwritten as (Na, [Ne]3 s^1 ) to (Ar, [Ne] 3 s^23 p^6 ). The\\\\nelectrons in the completely filled shells are\\\\nknown as core electrons and the electrons that\\\\nare added to the electronic shell with the\\\\nhighest principal quantum number are called\\\\nvalence electrons. For example, the electrons\\\\nin Ne are the core electrons and the electrons\\\\nfrom Na to Ar are the valence electrons. In\\\\npotassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4 s orbital,\\\\nbeing lower in energy than the 3 d orbitals, is\\\\noccupied by one and two electrons respectively.\\\\n\\\\nfilling of 6 p , then 7 s and finally 5 f and 6 d\\\\norbitals takes place. The elements after\\\\nuranium (U) are all short-lived and all of them\\\\nare produced artificially. The electronic\\\\nconfigurations of the known elements (as\\\\ndetermined by spectroscopic methods) are\\\\ntabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66).\\\\nOne may ask what is the utility of knowing\\\\nthe electron configuration? The modern\\\\napproach to the chemistry, infact, depends\\\\nalmost entirely on electronic distribution to\\\\nunderstand and explain chemical behaviour.\\\\nFor example, questions like why two or more\\\\natoms combine to form molecules, why some\\\\nelements are metals while others are non-\\\\nmetals, why elements like helium and argon\\\\nare not reactive but elements like the halogens\\\\nare reactive, find simple explanation from the\\\\nelectronic configuration. These questions have\\\\nno answer in the Daltonian model of atom. A\\\\ndetailed understanding of the electronic\\\\nstructure of atom is, therefore, very essential\\\\nfor getting an insight into the various aspects\\\\nof modern chemical knowledge.\\\\n2.6.6 Stability of Completely Filled and\\\\nHalf Filled Subshells\\\\nThe ground state electronic configuration of the\\\\natom of an element always corresponds to the\\\\nstate of the lowest total electronic energy. The\\\\nelectronic configurations of most of the atoms\\\\nfollow the basic rules given in Section 2.6.5.\\\\nHowever, in certain elements such as Cu, or\\\\nCr, where the two subshells (4 s and 3 d ) differ\\\\nslightly in their energies, an electron shifts from\\\\na subshell of lower energy (4 s ) to a subshell of\\\\nhigher energy (3 d ), provided such a shift\\\\nresults in all orbitals of the subshell of higher\\\\nenergy getting either completely filled or half\\\\nfilled. The valence electronic configurations of\\\\nCr and Cu, therefore, are 3 d^5 4 s^1 and 3 d^10 4 s^1\\\\nrespectively and not 3 d^4 4 s^2 and 3 d^9 4 s^2. It has\\\\nbeen found that there is extra stability\\\\nassociated with these electronic configurations.\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 65\\\\n\\\\nThe completely filled and completely\\\\nhalf-filled subshells are stable due to\\\\nthe following reasons:\\\\n1.Symmetrical distribution of\\\\nelectrons: It is well known that symmetry\\\\nleads to stability. The completely filled or\\\\nhalf filled subshells have symmetrical\\\\ndistribution of electrons in them and are\\\\ntherefore more stable. Electrons in the\\\\nsame subshell (here 3d ) have equal energy\\\\nbut different spatial distribution.\\\\nConsequently, their shielding of one-\\\\nanother is relatively small and the\\\\nelectrons are more strongly attracted by\\\\nthe nucleus.\\\\n2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing\\\\neffect arises whenever two or more\\\\nelectrons with the same spin are present\\\\nin the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.\\\\nThese electrons tend to exchange their\\\\npositions and the energy released due to\\\\nthis exchange is called exchange energy.\\\\nThe number of exchanges that can take\\\\nplace is maximum when the subshell is\\\\neither half filled or completely filled (Fig.\\\\n2.18). As a result the exchange energy is\\\\nmaximum and so is the stability.\\\\n    You may note that the exchange\\\\nenergy is at the basis of Hund’s rule that\\\\nelectrons which enter orbitals of equal\\\\nenergy have parallel spins as far as\\\\npossible. In other words, the extra\\\\nstability of half-filled and completely filled\\\\nsubshell is due to: (i) relatively small\\\\nshielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion\\\\nenergy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.\\\\nDetails about the exchange energy will be\\\\ndealt with in higher classes.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 2.18 Possible exchange for a d^5\\\\nconfiguration\\\\nCauses of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells\\\\n\\\\n66 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nTable 2.6 Electronic Configurations of the Elements\\\\n* Elements with exceptional electronic configurations\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 67\\\\n\\\\n** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.\\\\n\\\\n68 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nSUMMARY\\\\nAtoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element\\\\nthat chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded\\\\natom as the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth\\\\ncentury, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three\\\\nfundamental particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic\\\\nparticles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\\\\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity\\\\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be\\\\nevenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle\\\\nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively\\\\ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits.\\\\nRutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over\\\\nThomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron\\\\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of\\\\natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus.\\\\nThe difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model\\\\nof the hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular\\\\norbits. Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr\\\\ncalculated the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance\\\\nbetween the electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for\\\\nexplaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron\\\\natoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as\\\\na charged particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave\\\\ncharacter of the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and\\\\nthis path can completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of\\\\nthe electron at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg\\\\nuncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the\\\\ndual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\\\\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to describe\\\\nthe electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation\\\\nincorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with Heisenberg\\\\nuncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen\\\\natom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the\\\\ncorresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the\\\\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding\\\\nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal\\\\nquantum number n , azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml )\\\\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions\\\\non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The\\\\nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the\\\\nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the\\\\nBohr model.\\\\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an\\\\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought\\\\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or\\\\nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems\\\\n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of\\\\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l : The lower the\\\\nvalue of ( n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same ( n + l )\\\\nvalue, the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals\\\\nare possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 69\\\\n\\\\n70 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n2.14 How much energy is required to ionise a H atom if the electron occupies n = 5\\\\norbit?

It is a remarkable demonstration of the\\\\nfact that the chemical elements are not a random cluster of\\\\nentities but instead display trends and lie together in families.\\\\nAn awareness of the Periodic Table is essential to anyone who\\\\nwishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up\\\\nfrom the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the\\\\nchemical elements.\\\\nGlenn T.

We will also learn how the periodic classification\\\\nfollows as a logical consequence of the electronic\\\\nconfiguration of atoms. Finally, we shall examine some of\\\\nthe periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties\\\\nof the elements.\\\\n\\\\n3.1 Why do we Need to Classify Elements?\\\\n\\\\nWe know by now that the elements are the basic units of all\\\\ntypes of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By\\\\n1865, the number of identified elements had more than\\\\ndoubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of\\\\nthem, the recently discovered elements are man-made.\\\\nEfforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With\\\\nsuch a large number of elements it is very difficult to study\\\\nindividually the chemistry of all these elements and their\\\\ninnumerable compounds individually. To ease out this\\\\nproblem, scientists searched for a systematic way to\\\\norganise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not\\\\nonly that it would rationalize known chemical facts about\\\\nelements, but even predict new ones for undertaking further\\\\nstudy.\\\\nUNIT 3\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND\\\\n\\\\nPERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 75\\\\n\\\\n3.2 Genesis of Periodic Classification\\\\n\\\\n76 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nelements that closely resembles the Modern\\\\nPeriodic Table. However, his work was not\\\\npublished until after the work of Dmitri\\\\nMendeleev, the scientist who is generally\\\\ncredited with the development of the Modern\\\\nPeriodic Table.\\\\n\\\\nWhile Dobereiner initiated the study of\\\\nperiodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who\\\\nwas responsible for publishing the Periodic\\\\nLaw for the first time. It states as follows :\\\\n\\\\nThe properties of the elements are a\\\\nperiodic function of their atomic\\\\nweights.\\\\nMendeleev arranged elements in horizontal\\\\nrows and vertical columns of a table in order\\\\nof their increasing atomic weights in such a\\\\nway that the elements with similar properties\\\\noccupied the same vertical column or group.\\\\nMendeleev’s system of classifying elements was\\\\nmore elaborate than that of Lothar Meyer’s.\\\\nHe fully recognized the significance of\\\\nperiodicity and used broader range of physical\\\\nand chemical properties to classify the\\\\nelements. In particular, Mendeleev relied on\\\\nthe similarities in the empirical formulas and\\\\nproperties of the compounds formed by the\\\\nelements. He realized that some of the elements\\\\ndid not fit in with his scheme of classification\\\\nif the order of atomic weight was strictly\\\\nfollowed. He ignored the order of atomic\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 77\\\\n\\\\nPERIODIC SYSTEM OF THE ELEMENTS IN GROUPS AND SERIES\\\\nFig. 3.1\\\\nMendeleev’s Periodic Table published earlier\\\\n2018-19\\\\n\\\\n78 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nDmitri Mendeleev was born in Tobalsk, Siberia in Russia. After his\\\\nfather’s death, the family moved to St. Petersburg. He received his\\\\nMaster’s degree in Chemistry in 1856 and the doctoral degree in\\\\n1865. He taught at the University of St.Petersburg where he was\\\\nappointed Professor of General Chemistry in 1867. Preliminary work\\\\nfor his great textbook “Principles of Chemistry” led Mendeleev to\\\\npropose the Periodic Law and to construct his Periodic Table of\\\\nelements. At that time, the structure of atom was unknown and\\\\nMendeleev’s idea to consider that the properties of the elements\\\\nwere in someway related to their atomic masses was a very\\\\nimaginative one. To place certain elements into the correct group from\\\\nthe point of view of their chemical properties, Mendeleev reversed the\\\\norder of some pairs of elements and asserted that their atomic masses\\\\nwere incorrect. Mendeleev also had the foresight to leave gaps in the Periodic Table for\\\\nelements unknown at that time and predict their properties from the trends that he observed\\\\namong the properties of related elements. Mendeleev’s predictions were proved to be\\\\nastonishingly correct when these elements were discovered later.\\\\n    Mendeleev’s Periodic Law spurred several areas of research during the subsequent\\\\ndecades. The discovery of the first two noble gases helium and argon in 1890 suggested\\\\nthe possibility that there must be other similar elements to fill an entire family. This idea\\\\nled Ramsay to his successful search for krypton and xenon. Work on the radioactive decay\\\\nseries for uranium and thorium in the early years of twentieth century was also guided by\\\\nthe Periodic Table.\\\\n    Mendeleev was a versatile genius. He worked on many problems connected with\\\\nRussia’s natural resources. He invented an accurate barometer. In 1890, he resigned from\\\\nthe Professorship.

In 1913, the\\\\nEnglish physicist, Henry Moseley observed\\\\nregularities in the characteristic X-ray spectra\\\\nof the elements. A plot of ν (where ν is\\\\nfrequency of X -rays emitted) against atomic\\\\nnumber ( Z ) gave a straight line and not the\\\\nplot of ν vs atomic mass. He thereby showed\\\\nthat the atomic number is a more fundamental\\\\nproperty of an element than its atomic mass.\\\\nMendeleev’s Periodic Law was, therefore,\\\\naccordingly modified. This is known as the\\\\nModern Periodic Law and can be stated as :\\\\nThe physical and chemical properties\\\\nof the elements are periodic functions\\\\nof their atomic numbers.\\\\nThe Periodic Law revealed important\\\\nanalogies among the 94 naturally occurring\\\\nelements (neptunium and plutonium like\\\\nactinium and protoactinium are also found in\\\\npitch blende – an ore of uranium). It stimulated\\\\nrenewed interest in Inorganic Chemistry and\\\\nhas carried into the present with the creation\\\\nof artificially produced short-lived elements.\\\\nYou may recall that the atomic number is\\\\nequal to the nuclear charge ( i.e. , number of\\\\nprotons) or the number of electrons in a neutral\\\\natom. It is then easy to visualize the significance\\\\nof quantum numbers and electronic\\\\nconfigurations in periodicity of elements. In\\\\nfact, it is now recognized that the Periodic Law\\\\nis essentially the consequence of the periodic\\\\nvariation in electronic configurations, which\\\\nindeed determine the physical and chemical\\\\nproperties of elements and their compounds.\\\\nNumerous forms of Periodic Table have\\\\nbeen devised from time to time. Some forms\\\\nemphasise chemical reactions and valence,\\\\nwhereas others stress the electronic\\\\nconfiguration of elements. A modern version,\\\\nthe so-called “long form” of the Periodic Table\\\\nof the elements (Fig. 3.2), is the most convenient\\\\nand widely used. The horizontal rows (which\\\\nMendeleev called series) are called periods and\\\\nthe vertical columns, groups. Elements having\\\\nsimilar outer electronic configurations in their\\\\natoms are arranged in vertical columns,\\\\nreferred to as groups or families. According\\\\nto the recommendation of International Union\\\\nof Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the\\\\ngroups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing\\\\nthe older notation of groups IA ... VIIA, VIII, IB\\\\n... VIIB and 0.\\\\nThere are altogether seven periods. The\\\\nperiod number corresponds to the highest\\\\nprincipal quantum number ( n ) of the elements\\\\nin the period. The first period contains 2\\\\nelements. The subsequent periods consists of\\\\n8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements,', 'An orbit is a clearly defined path and\\\\nthis path can completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of\\\\nthe electron at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg\\\\nuncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the\\\\ndual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\\\\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to describe\\\\nthe electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation\\\\nincorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with Heisenberg\\\\nuncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen\\\\natom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the\\\\ncorresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the\\\\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding\\\\nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal\\\\nquantum number n , azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml )\\\\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions\\\\non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The\\\\nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the\\\\nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the\\\\nBohr model.\\\\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an\\\\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought\\\\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or\\\\nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems\\\\n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of\\\\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l : The lower the\\\\nvalue of ( n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same ( n + l )\\\\nvalue, the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals\\\\nare possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in\\\\n\\\\nSTRUCTURE OF ATOM 69\\\\n\\\\n70 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n2.14 How much energy is required to ionise a H atom if the electron occupies n = 5\\\\norbit?

It is the everyday\\\\nsupport for students, it suggests new avenues of research to\\\\nprofessionals, and it provides a succinct organization of the\\\\nwhole of chemistry. It is a remarkable demonstration of the\\\\nfact that the chemical elements are not a random cluster of\\\\nentities but instead display trends and lie together in families.\\\\nAn awareness of the Periodic Table is essential to anyone who\\\\nwishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up\\\\nfrom the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the\\\\nchemical elements.\\\\nGlenn T. Seaborg\\\\nIn this Unit, we will study the historical development of the\\\\nPeriodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic\\\\nLaw. We will also learn how the periodic classification\\\\nfollows as a logical consequence of the electronic\\\\nconfiguration of atoms. Finally, we shall examine some of\\\\nthe periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties\\\\nof the elements.\\\\n\\\\n3.1 Why do we Need to Classify Elements?\\\\n\\\\nWe know by now that the elements are the basic units of all\\\\ntypes of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By\\\\n1865, the number of identified elements had more than\\\\ndoubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of\\\\nthem, the recently discovered elements are man-made.\\\\nEfforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With\\\\nsuch a large number of elements it is very difficult to study\\\\nindividually the chemistry of all these elements and their\\\\ninnumerable compounds individually. To ease out this\\\\nproblem, scientists searched for a systematic way to\\\\norganise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not\\\\nonly that it would rationalize known chemical facts about\\\\nelements, but even predict new ones for undertaking further\\\\nstudy.\\\\nUNIT 3\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND\\\\n\\\\nPERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 75\\\\n\\\\n3.2 Genesis of Periodic Classification\\\\n\\\\n76 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nelements that closely resembles the Modern\\\\nPeriodic Table. However, his work was not\\\\npublished until after the work of Dmitri\\\\nMendeleev, the scientist who is generally\\\\ncredited with the development of the Modern\\\\nPeriodic Table.\\\\n\\\\nWhile Dobereiner initiated the study of\\\\nperiodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who\\\\nwas responsible for publishing the Periodic\\\\nLaw for the first time. It states as follows :\\\\n\\\\nThe properties of the elements are a\\\\nperiodic function of their atomic\\\\nweights.\\\\nMendeleev arranged elements in horizontal\\\\nrows and vertical columns of a table in order\\\\nof their increasing atomic weights in such a\\\\nway that the elements with similar properties\\\\noccupied the same vertical column or group.\\\\nMendeleev’s system of classifying elements was\\\\nmore elaborate than that of Lothar Meyer’s.\\\\nHe fully recognized the significance of\\\\nperiodicity and used broader range of physical\\\\nand chemical properties to classify the\\\\nelements. In particular, Mendeleev relied on\\\\nthe similarities in the empirical formulas and\\\\nproperties of the compounds formed by the\\\\nelements. He realized that some of the elements\\\\ndid not fit in with his scheme of classification\\\\nif the order of atomic weight was strictly\\\\nfollowed. He ignored the order of atomic\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 77\\\\n\\\\nPERIODIC SYSTEM OF THE ELEMENTS IN GROUPS AND SERIES\\\\nFig. 3.1\\\\nMendeleev’s Periodic Table published earlier\\\\n2018-19\\\\n\\\\n78 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nDmitri Mendeleev was born in Tobalsk, Siberia in Russia. After his\\\\nfather’s death, the family moved to St. Petersburg. He received his\\\\nMaster’s degree in Chemistry in 1856 and the doctoral degree in\\\\n1865. He taught at the University of St.Petersburg where he was\\\\nappointed Professor of General Chemistry in 1867. Preliminary work\\\\nfor his great textbook “Principles of Chemistry” led Mendeleev to\\\\npropose the Periodic Law and to construct his Periodic Table of\\\\nelements. At that time, the structure of atom was unknown and\\\\nMendeleev’s idea to consider that the properties of the elements\\\\nwere in someway related to their atomic masses was a very\\\\nimaginative one. To place certain elements into the correct group from\\\\nthe point of view of their chemical properties, Mendeleev reversed the\\\\norder of some pairs of elements and asserted that their atomic masses\\\\nwere incorrect. Mendeleev also had the foresight to leave gaps in the Periodic Table for\\\\nelements unknown at that time and predict their properties from the trends that he observed\\\\namong the properties of related elements. Mendeleev’s predictions were proved to be\\\\nastonishingly correct when these elements were discovered later.\\\\n    Mendeleev’s Periodic Law spurred several areas of research during the subsequent\\\\ndecades. The discovery of the first two noble gases helium and argon in 1890 suggested\\\\nthe possibility that there must be other similar elements to fill an entire family. This idea\\\\nled Ramsay to his successful search for krypton and xenon. Work on the radioactive decay\\\\nseries for uranium and thorium in the early years of twentieth century was also guided by\\\\nthe Periodic Table.\\\\n    Mendeleev was a versatile genius. He worked on many problems connected with\\\\nRussia’s natural resources. He invented an accurate barometer. In 1890, he resigned from\\\\nthe Professorship. He was appointed as the Director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures.\\\\nHe continued to carry out important research work in many areas until his death in 1907.\\\\n    You will notice from the modern Period Table (Fig. 3.2) that Mendeleev’s name has\\\\nbeen immortalized by naming the element with atomic number 101, as Mendelevium.

We have also studied\\\\nabout the filling of electrons into different\\\\nsubshells, also referred to as orbitals ( s, p, d,\\\\nf ) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into\\\\norbitals of an atom is called its electronic\\\\nconfiguration. An element’s location in the\\\\nPeriodic Table reflects the quantum numbers\\\\nof the last orbital filled. In this section we will\\\\nobserve a direct connection between the\\\\nelectronic configurations of the elements and\\\\nthe long form of the Periodic Table.\\\\n\\\\n(a) Electronic Configurations in Periods\\\\n\\\\nThe period indicates the value of n for the\\\\noutermost or valence shell. In other words,\\\\nsuccessive period in the Periodic Table is\\\\nassociated with the filling of the next higher\\\\nprincipal energy level ( n = 1, n = 2, etc.). It can\\\\n\\\\nbe readily seen that the number of elements in\\\\neach period is twice the number of atomic\\\\norbitals available in the energy level that is\\\\nbeing filled. The first period ( n = 1) starts with\\\\nthe filling of the lowest level (1 s ) and therefore\\\\nhas two elements — hydrogen (l s^1 ) and helium\\\\n(l s^2 ) when the first shell ( K ) is completed. The\\\\nsecond period ( n = 2) starts with lithium and\\\\nthe third electron enters the 2 s orbital. The next\\\\nelement, beryllium has four electrons and has\\\\nthe electronic configuration 1 s^22 s^2. Starting\\\\nfrom the next element boron, the 2 p orbitals\\\\nare filled with electrons when the L shell is\\\\ncompleted at neon (2 s^22 p^6 ). Thus there are\\\\n8 elements in the second period. The third\\\\nperiod ( n = 3) begins at sodium, and the added\\\\nelectron enters a 3 s orbital. Successive filling\\\\nof 3 s and 3 p orbitals gives rise to the third\\\\nperiod of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The\\\\nfourth period ( n = 4) starts at potassium, and\\\\nthe added electrons fill up the 4 s orbital. Now\\\\nyou may note that before the 4 p orbital is filled,\\\\nfilling up of 3 d orbitals becomes energetically\\\\nfavourable and we come across the so called\\\\n3 d transition series of elements. This starts\\\\nfrom scandium ( Z = 21) which has the electronic\\\\nconfiguration 3 d^14 s^2. The 3 d orbitals are filled\\\\nat zinc ( Z =30) with electronic configuration\\\\n3 d^104 s^2. The fourth period ends at krypton\\\\nwith the filling up of the 4 p orbitals. Altogether\\\\nwe have 18 elements in this fourth period. The\\\\nfifth period ( n = 5) beginning with rubidium is\\\\nsimilar to the fourth period and contains the\\\\n4 d transition series starting at yttrium\\\\n( Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the\\\\nfilling up of the 5 p orbitals. The sixth period\\\\n( n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive\\\\nelectrons enter 6 s , 4 f , 5 d and 6 p orbitals, in\\\\nthe order — filling up of the 4 f orbitals begins\\\\nwith cerium ( Z = 58) and ends at lutetium\\\\n( Z = 71) to give the 4 f - inner transition series\\\\nwhich is called the lanthanoid series. The\\\\nseventh period ( n = 7) is similar to the sixth\\\\nperiod with the successive filling up of the 7 s ,\\\\n5 f , 6 d and 7 p orbitals and includes most of\\\\nthe man-made radioactive elements. This\\\\nperiod will end at the element with atomic\\\\nnumber 118 which would belong to the noble\\\\ngas family. Filling up of the 5 f orbitals after\\\\nactinium ( Z = 89) gives the 5 f - inner transition\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 83\\\\n\\\\nseries known as the actinoid series. The 4 f -\\\\nand 5 f - inner transition series of elements are\\\\nplaced separately in the Periodic Table to\\\\nmaintain its structure and to preserve the\\\\nprinciple of classification by keeping elements\\\\nwith similar properties in a single column.\\\\nProblem 3.2\\\\nHow would you justify the presence of 18\\\\nelements in the 5th period of the Periodic\\\\nTable?\\\\nSolution\\\\nWhen n = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order in\\\\nwhich the energy of the available orbitals\\\\n4 d , 5 s and 5 p increases is 5 s < 4 d < 5 p.\\\\nThe total number of orbitals available are\\\\n9. The maximum number of electrons that\\\\ncan be accommodated is 18; and therefore\\\\n18 elements are there in the 5th period.\\\\n\\\\n(b) Groupwise Electronic Configurations\\\\nElements in the same vertical column or group\\\\nhave similar valence shell electronic\\\\nconfigurations, the same number of electrons\\\\nin the outer orbitals, and similar properties.\\\\nFor example, the Group 1 elements (alkali\\\\nmetals) all have ns\\\\n1\\\\nvalence shell electronic\\\\nconfiguration as shown below.\\\\nAtomic number Symbol Electronic configuration\\\\n3 Li 1 s^22 s^1 (or) [He]2 s^1\\\\n11 Na 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^1 (or) [Ne]3 s^1\\\\n19 K 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^64 s^1 (or) [Ar]4 s^1\\\\n37 Rb 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^63 d^104 s^24 p^65 s^1 (or) [Kr]5 s^1\\\\n55 Cs 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^63 d^104 s^24 p^64 d^105 s^25 p^66 s^1 (or) [Xe]6 s^1\\\\n87 Fr [Rn]7 s^1\\\\ntheoretical foundation for the periodic\\\\nclassification. The elements in a vertical column\\\\nof the Periodic Table constitute a group or\\\\nfamily and exhibit similar chemical behaviour.\\\\nThis similarity arises because these elements\\\\nhave the same number and same distribution\\\\nof electrons in their outermost orbitals. We can\\\\nclassify the elements into four blocks viz .,\\\\ns -block, p -block, d -block and f -block\\\\ndepending on the type of atomic orbitals that\\\\nare being filled with electrons. This is illustrated\\\\nin Fig. 3.3. We notice two exceptions to this\\\\ncategorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the\\\\ns -block but its positioning in the p -block along\\\\nwith other group 18 elements is justified\\\\nbecause it has a completely filled valence shell\\\\n(1 s^2 ) and as a result, exhibits properties\\\\ncharacteristic of other noble gases. The other\\\\nexception is hydrogen. It has only one\\\\ns -electron and hence can be placed in group 1\\\\n(alkali metals). It can also gain an electron to\\\\nachieve a noble gas arrangement and hence it\\\\ncan behave similar to a group 17 (halogen\\\\nfamily) elements. Because it is a special case,\\\\nwe shall place hydrogen separately at the top\\\\nof the Periodic Table as shown in Fig. 3.2 and\\\\nFig. 3.3. We will briefly discuss the salient\\\\nfeatures of the four types of elements marked in\\\\nThus it can be seen that the properties of\\\\nan element have periodic dependence upon its\\\\natomic number and not on relative atomic\\\\nmass.\\\\n\\\\n3.6 Electronic Configurations and Types of Elements:\\\\n\\\\ns-, p-, d-, f- BLOCKS\\\\nThe aufbau (build up) principle and the\\\\nelectronic configuration of atoms provide a\\\\n\\\\nthe Periodic Table. More about these elements\\\\nwill be discussed later. During the description\\\\nof their features certain terminology has been\\\\nused which has been classified in section 3.7.\\\\n3.6.1 The s -Block Elements\\\\nThe elements of Group 1 (alkali metals) and\\\\nGroup 2 (alkaline earth metals) which have ns^1\\\\n\\\\n84 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 85\\\\n\\\\nand ns^2 outermost electronic configuration\\\\nbelong to the s- Block Elements. They are all\\\\nreactive metals with low ionization enthalpies.\\\\nThey lose the outermost electron(s) readily to\\\\nform 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+\\\\nion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The\\\\nmetallic character and the reactivity increase\\\\nas we go down the group. Because of high\\\\nreactivity they are never found pure in nature.\\\\nThe compounds of the s- block elements, with\\\\nthe exception of those of lithium and beryllium\\\\nare predominantly ionic.\\\\n3.6.2 The p- Block Elements\\\\nThe p -Block Elements comprise those\\\\nbelonging to Group 13 to 18 and these\\\\ntogether with the s- Block Elements are called\\\\nthe Representative Elements or Main Group\\\\nElements. The outermost electronic\\\\nconfiguration varies from ns^2 np^1 to ns^2 np^6 in\\\\neach period. At the end of each period is a noble\\\\ngas element with a closed valence shell ns^2 np^6\\\\nconfiguration. All the orbitals in the valence\\\\nshell of the noble gases are completely filled\\\\nby electrons and it is very difficult to alter this\\\\nstable arrangement by the addition or removal\\\\nof electrons. The noble gases thus exhibit very\\\\nlow chemical reactivity. Preceding the noble gas\\\\nfamily are two chemically important groups of\\\\nnon-metals. They are the halogens (Group 17)\\\\nand the chalcogens (Group 16). These two\\\\ngroups of elements have highly negative\\\\nelectron gain enthalpies and readily add one\\\\nor two electrons respectively to attain the stable\\\\nnoble gas configuration. The non-metallic\\\\ncharacter increases as we move from left to right\\\\nacross a period and metallic character increases\\\\nas we go down the group.\\\\n3.6.3 The d- Block Elements (Transition\\\\nElements)\\\\nThese are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the\\\\ncentre of the Periodic Table. These are\\\\ncharacterised by the filling of inner d orbitals\\\\nby electrons and are therefore referred to as\\\\nd- Block Elements. These elements have the\\\\ngeneral outer electronic configuration\\\\n( n- 1) d 1-10 ns 0-2. They are all metals. They mostly\\\\nform coloured ions, exhibit variable valence\\\\n(oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly\\\\nused as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg\\\\nwhich have the electronic configuration,\\\\n( n- 1) d^10 ns^2 do not show most of the properties\\\\nof transition elements. In a way, transition\\\\nmetals form a bridge between the chemically\\\\nactive metals of s- block elements and the less\\\\nactive elements of Groups 13 and 14 and thus\\\\ntake their familiar name “Transition\\\\nElements”.\\\\n3.6.4 The f- Block Elements\\\\n(Inner-Transition Elements)\\\\nThe two rows of elements at the bottom of the\\\\nPeriodic Table, called the Lanthanoids,\\\\nCe( Z = 58) – Lu( Z = 71) and Actinoids,\\\\nTh( Z = 90) – Lr ( Z = 103) are characterised by\\\\nthe outer electronic configuration ( n -2) f 1-14\\\\n( n -1) d 0–1 ns^2. The last electron added to each\\\\nelement is filled in f- orbital. These two series\\\\nof elements are hence called the Inner-\\\\nTransition Elements ( f- Block Elements).\\\\nThey are all metals. Within each series, the\\\\nproperties of the elements are quite similar. The\\\\nchemistry of the early actinoids is more\\\\ncomplicated than the corresponding\\\\nlanthanoids, due to the large number of\\\\noxidation states possible for these actinoid\\\\nelements. Actinoid elements are radioactive.\\\\nMany of the actinoid elements have been made\\\\nonly in nanogram quantities or even less by\\\\nnuclear reactions and their chemistry is not\\\\nfully studied. The elements after uranium are\\\\ncalled Transuranium Elements.\\\\nProblem 3.3\\\\nThe elements Z = 117 and 120 have not\\\\nyet been discovered. In which family /\\\\ngroup would you place these elements\\\\nand also give the electronic configuration\\\\nin each case.\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe see from Fig. 3.2, that element with Z\\\\n= 117, would belong to the halogen family\\\\n(Group 17) and the electronic\\\\nconfiguration would be [Rn]\\\\n5 f^146 d^107 s^27 p^5. The element with Z = 120,\\\\nwill be placed in Group 2 (alkaline earth\\\\nmetals), and will have the electronic\\\\nconfiguration [Uuo]8 s^2.\\\\n\\\\n86 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n3.6.5 Metals, Non-metals and Metalloids\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to displaying the classification of\\\\nelements into s- , p- , d- , and f- blocks, Fig. 3.3\\\\nshows another broad classification of elements\\\\nbased on their properties. The elements can\\\\nbe divided into Metals and Non-Metals. Metals\\\\ncomprise more than 78% of all known elements\\\\nand appear on the left side of the Periodic\\\\nTable. Metals are usually solids at room\\\\ntemperature [mercury is an exception; gallium\\\\nand caesium also have very low melting points\\\\n(303K and 302K, respectively)]. Metals usually\\\\nhave high melting and boiling points. They are\\\\ngood conductors of heat and electricity. They\\\\nare malleable (can be flattened into thin sheets\\\\nby hammering) and ductile (can be drawn into\\\\nwires). In contrast, non-metals are located at\\\\nthe top right hand side of the Periodic Table.\\\\nIn fact, in a horizontal row, the property of\\\\nelements change from metallic on the left to\\\\nnon-metallic on the right. Non-metals are\\\\nusually solids or gases at room temperature\\\\nwith low melting and boiling points (boron and\\\\ncarbon are exceptions). They are poor\\\\nconductors of heat and electricity. Most non-\\\\nmetallic solids are brittle and are neither\\\\nmalleable nor ductile. The elements become\\\\nmore metallic as we go down a group; the non-\\\\nmetallic character increases as one goes from\\\\nleft to right across the Periodic Table. The\\\\nchange from metallic to non-metallic character\\\\nis not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag\\\\nline in Fig. 3.3. The elements (e.g., silicon,\\\\ngermanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium)\\\\nbordering this line and running diagonally\\\\nacross the Periodic Table show properties that\\\\nare characteristic of both metals and non-\\\\nmetals. These elements are called Semi-metals\\\\nor Metalloids.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 3.4\\\\nConsidering the atomic number and\\\\nposition in the periodic table, arrange the\\\\nfollowing elements in the increasing order\\\\nof metallic character : Si, Be, Mg, Na, P.\\\\nSolution\\\\nMetallic character increases down a group\\\\nand decreases along a period as we move\\\\nfrom left to right. Hence the order of\\\\nincreasing metallic character is: P < Si <\\\\nBe < Mg < Na.\\\\n3.7 PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES\\\\nOF ELEMENTS\\\\nThere are many observable patterns in', 'respectively. The\\\\nseventh period is incomplete and like the sixth\\\\nperiod would have a theoretical maximum (on\\\\nthe basis of quantum numbers) of 32 elements.\\\\nIn this form of the Periodic Table, 14 elements\\\\nof both sixth and seventh periods (lanthanoids\\\\nand actinoids, respectively) are placed in\\\\nseparate panels at the bottom*.\\\\n3.4 NOMENCLATURE OF ELEMENTS WITH\\\\nATOMIC NUMBERS > 100\\\\nThe naming of the new elements had been\\\\ntraditionally the privilege of the discoverer (or\\\\ndiscoverers) and the suggested name was\\\\nratified by the IUPAC. In recent years this has\\\\nled to some controversy. The new elements with\\\\nvery high atomic numbers are so unstable that\\\\nonly minute quantities, sometimes only a few\\\\natoms of them are obtained. Their synthesis\\\\nand characterisation, therefore, require highly\\\\n* Glenn T. Seaborg’s work in the middle of the 20th century starting with the discovery of plutonium in 1940, followed by\\\\nthose of all the transuranium elements from 94 to 102 led to reconfiguration of the periodic table placing the actinoids\\\\nbelow the lanthanoids.

To avoid such\\\\nproblems, the IUPAC has made\\\\nrecommendation that until a new element’s\\\\ndiscovery is proved, and its name is officially\\\\nrecognised, a systematic nomenclature be\\\\nderived directly from the atomic number of the\\\\nelement using the numerical roots for 0 and\\\\nnumbers 1-9.

Hence, the\\\\nsymbol and the name respectively are Ubn\\\\nand unbinilium.\\\\n\\\\n3.5 Electronic Configurations of Elements and the Periodic Table\\\\n\\\\nIn the preceding unit we have learnt that an\\\\nelectron in an atom is characterised by a set of\\\\nfour quantum numbers, and the principal\\\\nquantum number ( n ) defines the main energy\\\\nlevel known as shell. We have also studied\\\\nabout the filling of electrons into different\\\\nsubshells, also referred to as orbitals ( s, p, d,\\\\nf ) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into\\\\norbitals of an atom is called its electronic\\\\nconfiguration. An element’s location in the\\\\nPeriodic Table reflects the quantum numbers\\\\nof the last orbital filled. In this section we will\\\\nobserve a direct connection between the\\\\nelectronic configurations of the elements and\\\\nthe long form of the Periodic Table.\\\\n\\\\n(a) Electronic Configurations in Periods\\\\n\\\\nThe period indicates the value of n for the\\\\noutermost or valence shell. In other words,\\\\nsuccessive period in the Periodic Table is\\\\nassociated with the filling of the next higher\\\\nprincipal energy level ( n = 1, n = 2, etc.). It can\\\\n\\\\nbe readily seen that the number of elements in\\\\neach period is twice the number of atomic\\\\norbitals available in the energy level that is\\\\nbeing filled. The first period ( n = 1) starts with\\\\nthe filling of the lowest level (1 s ) and therefore\\\\nhas two elements — hydrogen (l s^1 ) and helium\\\\n(l s^2 ) when the first shell ( K ) is completed. The\\\\nsecond period ( n = 2) starts with lithium and\\\\nthe third electron enters the 2 s orbital. The next\\\\nelement, beryllium has four electrons and has\\\\nthe electronic configuration 1 s^22 s^2. Starting\\\\nfrom the next element boron, the 2 p orbitals\\\\nare filled with electrons when the L shell is\\\\ncompleted at neon (2 s^22 p^6 ). Thus there are\\\\n8 elements in the second period. The third\\\\nperiod ( n = 3) begins at sodium, and the added\\\\nelectron enters a 3 s orbital. Successive filling\\\\nof 3 s and 3 p orbitals gives rise to the third\\\\nperiod of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The\\\\nfourth period ( n = 4) starts at potassium, and\\\\nthe added electrons fill up the 4 s orbital. Now\\\\nyou may note that before the 4 p orbital is filled,\\\\nfilling up of 3 d orbitals becomes energetically\\\\nfavourable and we come across the so called\\\\n3 d transition series of elements. This starts\\\\nfrom scandium ( Z = 21) which has the electronic\\\\nconfiguration 3 d^14 s^2. The 3 d orbitals are filled\\\\nat zinc ( Z =30) with electronic configuration\\\\n3 d^104 s^2. The fourth period ends at krypton\\\\nwith the filling up of the 4 p orbitals. Altogether\\\\nwe have 18 elements in this fourth period. The\\\\nfifth period ( n = 5) beginning with rubidium is\\\\nsimilar to the fourth period and contains the\\\\n4 d transition series starting at yttrium\\\\n( Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the\\\\nfilling up of the 5 p orbitals. The sixth period\\\\n( n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive\\\\nelectrons enter 6 s , 4 f , 5 d and 6 p orbitals, in\\\\nthe order — filling up of the 4 f orbitals begins\\\\nwith cerium ( Z = 58) and ends at lutetium\\\\n( Z = 71) to give the 4 f - inner transition series\\\\nwhich is called the lanthanoid series. The\\\\nseventh period ( n = 7) is similar to the sixth\\\\nperiod with the successive filling up of the 7 s ,\\\\n5 f , 6 d and 7 p orbitals and includes most of\\\\nthe man-made radioactive elements. This\\\\nperiod will end at the element with atomic\\\\nnumber 118 which would belong to the noble\\\\ngas family. Filling up of the 5 f orbitals after\\\\nactinium ( Z = 89) gives the 5 f - inner transition\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 83\\\\n\\\\nseries known as the actinoid series. The 4 f -\\\\nand 5 f - inner transition series of elements are\\\\nplaced separately in the Periodic Table to\\\\nmaintain its structure and to preserve the\\\\nprinciple of classification by keeping elements\\\\nwith similar properties in a single column.\\\\nProblem 3.2\\\\nHow would you justify the presence of 18\\\\nelements in the 5th period of the Periodic\\\\nTable?\\\\nSolution\\\\nWhen n = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order in\\\\nwhich the energy of the available orbitals\\\\n4 d , 5 s and 5 p increases is 5 s < 4 d < 5 p.\\\\nThe total number of orbitals available are\\\\n9. The maximum number of electrons that\\\\ncan be accommodated is 18; and therefore\\\\n18 elements are there in the 5th period.\\\\n\\\\n(b) Groupwise Electronic Configurations\\\\nElements in the same vertical column or group\\\\nhave similar valence shell electronic\\\\nconfigurations, the same number of electrons\\\\nin the outer orbitals, and similar properties.\\\\nFor example, the Group 1 elements (alkali\\\\nmetals) all have ns\\\\n1\\\\nvalence shell electronic\\\\nconfiguration as shown below.\\\\nAtomic number Symbol Electronic configuration\\\\n3 Li 1 s^22 s^1 (or) [He]2 s^1\\\\n11 Na 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^1 (or) [Ne]3 s^1\\\\n19 K 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^64 s^1 (or) [Ar]4 s^1\\\\n37 Rb 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^63 d^104 s^24 p^65 s^1 (or) [Kr]5 s^1\\\\n55 Cs 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^63 d^104 s^24 p^64 d^105 s^25 p^66 s^1 (or) [Xe]6 s^1\\\\n87 Fr [Rn]7 s^1\\\\ntheoretical foundation for the periodic\\\\nclassification. The elements in a vertical column\\\\nof the Periodic Table constitute a group or\\\\nfamily and exhibit similar chemical behaviour.\\\\nThis similarity arises because these elements\\\\nhave the same number and same distribution\\\\nof electrons in their outermost orbitals. We can\\\\nclassify the elements into four blocks viz .,\\\\ns -block, p -block, d -block and f -block\\\\ndepending on the type of atomic orbitals that\\\\nare being filled with electrons. This is illustrated\\\\nin Fig. 3.3. We notice two exceptions to this\\\\ncategorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the\\\\ns -block but its positioning in the p -block along\\\\nwith other group 18 elements is justified\\\\nbecause it has a completely filled valence shell\\\\n(1 s^2 ) and as a result, exhibits properties\\\\ncharacteristic of other noble gases. The other\\\\nexception is hydrogen. It has only one\\\\ns -electron and hence can be placed in group 1\\\\n(alkali metals). It can also gain an electron to\\\\nachieve a noble gas arrangement and hence it\\\\ncan behave similar to a group 17 (halogen\\\\nfamily) elements. Because it is a special case,\\\\nwe shall place hydrogen separately at the top\\\\nof the Periodic Table as shown in Fig. 3.2 and\\\\nFig. 3.3. We will briefly discuss the salient\\\\nfeatures of the four types of elements marked in\\\\nThus it can be seen that the properties of\\\\nan element have periodic dependence upon its\\\\natomic number and not on relative atomic\\\\nmass.\\\\n\\\\n3.6 Electronic Configurations and Types of Elements:\\\\n\\\\ns-, p-, d-, f- BLOCKS\\\\nThe aufbau (build up) principle and the\\\\nelectronic configuration of atoms provide a\\\\n\\\\nthe Periodic Table. More about these elements\\\\nwill be discussed later. During the description\\\\nof their features certain terminology has been\\\\nused which has been classified in section 3.7.\\\\n3.6.1 The s -Block Elements\\\\nThe elements of Group 1 (alkali metals) and\\\\nGroup 2 (alkaline earth metals) which have ns^1\\\\n\\\\n84 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 85\\\\n\\\\nand ns^2 outermost electronic configuration\\\\nbelong to the s- Block Elements. They are all\\\\nreactive metals with low ionization enthalpies.\\\\nThey lose the outermost electron(s) readily to\\\\nform 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+\\\\nion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The\\\\nmetallic character and the reactivity increase\\\\nas we go down the group. Because of high\\\\nreactivity they are never found pure in nature.\\\\nThe compounds of the s- block elements, with\\\\nthe exception of those of lithium and beryllium\\\\nare predominantly ionic.\\\\n3.6.2 The p- Block Elements\\\\nThe p -Block Elements comprise those\\\\nbelonging to Group 13 to 18 and these\\\\ntogether with the s- Block Elements are called\\\\nthe Representative Elements or Main Group\\\\nElements. The outermost electronic\\\\nconfiguration varies from ns^2 np^1 to ns^2 np^6 in\\\\neach period. At the end of each period is a noble\\\\ngas element with a closed valence shell ns^2 np^6\\\\nconfiguration. All the orbitals in the valence\\\\nshell of the noble gases are completely filled\\\\nby electrons and it is very difficult to alter this\\\\nstable arrangement by the addition or removal\\\\nof electrons. The noble gases thus exhibit very\\\\nlow chemical reactivity. Preceding the noble gas\\\\nfamily are two chemically important groups of\\\\nnon-metals. They are the halogens (Group 17)\\\\nand the chalcogens (Group 16). These two\\\\ngroups of elements have highly negative\\\\nelectron gain enthalpies and readily add one\\\\nor two electrons respectively to attain the stable\\\\nnoble gas configuration. The non-metallic\\\\ncharacter increases as we move from left to right\\\\nacross a period and metallic character increases\\\\nas we go down the group.\\\\n3.6.3 The d- Block Elements (Transition\\\\nElements)\\\\nThese are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the\\\\ncentre of the Periodic Table. These are\\\\ncharacterised by the filling of inner d orbitals\\\\nby electrons and are therefore referred to as\\\\nd- Block Elements. These elements have the\\\\ngeneral outer electronic configuration\\\\n( n- 1) d 1-10 ns 0-2. They are all metals. They mostly\\\\nform coloured ions, exhibit variable valence\\\\n(oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly\\\\nused as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg\\\\nwhich have the electronic configuration,\\\\n( n- 1) d^10 ns^2 do not show most of the properties\\\\nof transition elements. In a way, transition\\\\nmetals form a bridge between the chemically\\\\nactive metals of s- block elements and the less\\\\nactive elements of Groups 13 and 14 and thus\\\\ntake their familiar name “Transition\\\\nElements”.\\\\n3.6.4 The f- Block Elements\\\\n(Inner-Transition Elements)\\\\nThe two rows of elements at the bottom of the\\\\nPeriodic Table, called the Lanthanoids,\\\\nCe( Z = 58) – Lu( Z = 71) and Actinoids,\\\\nTh( Z = 90) – Lr ( Z = 103) are characterised by\\\\nthe outer electronic configuration ( n -2) f 1-14\\\\n( n -1) d 0–1 ns^2. The last electron added to each\\\\nelement is filled in f- orbital. These two series\\\\nof elements are hence called the Inner-\\\\nTransition Elements ( f- Block Elements).\\\\nThey are all metals. Within each series, the\\\\nproperties of the elements are quite similar. The\\\\nchemistry of the early actinoids is more\\\\ncomplicated than the corresponding\\\\nlanthanoids, due to the large number of\\\\noxidation states possible for these actinoid\\\\nelements.

Hence the order of\\\\nincreasing metallic character is: P < Si <\\\\nBe < Mg < Na.\\\\n3.7 PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES\\\\nOF ELEMENTS\\\\nThere are many observable patterns in the\\\\nphysical and chemical properties of elements\\\\nas we descend in a group or move across a\\\\nperiod in the Periodic Table. For example,\\\\nwithin a period, chemical reactivity tends to be\\\\nhigh in Group 1 metals, lower in elements\\\\ntowards the middle of the table, and increases\\\\nto a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals.\\\\nLikewise within a group of representative\\\\nmetals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases\\\\non moving down the group, whereas within a\\\\ngroup of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity\\\\ndecreases down the group. But why do the\\\\nproperties of elements follow these trends? And\\\\nhow can we explain periodicity? To answer\\\\nthese questions, we must look into the theories\\\\nof atomic structure and properties of the atom.\\\\nIn this section we shall discuss the periodic\\\\ntrends in certain physical and chemical\\\\nproperties and try to explain them in terms of\\\\nnumber of electrons and energy levels.\\\\n3.7.1 Trends in Physical Properties\\\\nThere are numerous physical properties of\\\\nelements such as melting and boiling points,\\\\nheats of fusion and vaporization, energy of\\\\natomization, etc. which show periodic\\\\nvariations. However, we shall discuss the\\\\nperiodic trends with respect to atomic and ionic\\\\nradii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain\\\\nenthalpy and electronegativity.\\\\n(a)Atomic Radius\\\\nYou can very well imagine that finding the size\\\\nof an atom is a lot more complicated than\\\\nmeasuring the radius of a ball. Do you know\\\\nwhy? Firstly, because the size of an atom\\\\n(~ 1.2 Å i.e., 1.2 × 10–10 m in radius) is very\\\\nsmall. Secondly, since the electron cloud\\\\nsurrounding the atom does not have a sharp\\\\nboundary, the determination of the atomic size\\\\ncannot be precise. In other words, there is no\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 87\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 89\\\\n\\\\n90 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nthe actual charge on the nucleus because of\\\\n“shielding” or “screening” of the valence\\\\nelectron from the nucleus by the intervening\\\\ncore electrons. For example, the 2 s electron in\\\\nlithium is shielded from the nucleus by the\\\\ninner core of 1 s electrons. As a result, the\\\\nvalence electron experiences a net positive\\\\ncharge which is less than the actual charge of\\\\n+3. In general, shielding is effective when the\\\\norbitals in the inner shells are completely filled.\\\\nThis situation occurs in the case of alkali metals\\\\nwhich have single outermost ns -electron\\\\npreceded by a noble gas electronic\\\\nconfiguration.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we move from lithium to fluorine\\\\nacross the second period, successive electrons\\\\nare added to orbitals in the same principal\\\\nquantum level and the shielding of the nuclear\\\\ncharge by the inner core of electrons does not\\\\nincrease very much to compensate for the\\\\nincreased attraction of the electron to the\\\\nnucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing\\\\nnuclear charge outweighs the shielding.\\\\nConsequently, the outermost electrons are held\\\\nmore and more tightly and the ionization\\\\nenthalpy increases across a period. As we go\\\\ndown a group, the outermost electron being\\\\nincreasingly farther from the nucleus, there is\\\\nan increased shielding of the nuclear charge\\\\nby the electrons in the inner levels. In this case,\\\\nincrease in shielding outweighs the increasing\\\\nnuclear charge and the removal of the\\\\noutermost electron requires less energy down\\\\na group.\\\\n\\\\nto remove the 2 p -electron from boron compared\\\\nto the removal of a 2 s- electron from beryllium.\\\\nThus, boron has a smaller first ionization\\\\nenthalpy than beryllium. Another “anomaly”\\\\nis the smaller first ionization enthalpy of oxygen\\\\ncompared to nitrogen. This arises because in\\\\nthe nitrogen atom, three 2 p- electrons reside in\\\\ndifferent atomic orbitals (Hund’s rule) whereas\\\\nin the oxygen atom, two of the four 2 p- electrons\\\\nmust occupy the same 2 p- orbital resulting in\\\\nan increased electron-electron repulsion.\\\\nConsequently, it is easier to remove the fourth\\\\n2 p -electron from oxygen than it is, to remove\\\\none of the three 2 p -electrons from nitrogen.\\\\nProblem 3.6\\\\nThe first ionization enthalpy (∆ i H ) values\\\\nof the third period elements, Na, Mg and\\\\nSi are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ\\\\nmol–1. Predict whether the first ∆ i H value\\\\nfor Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ\\\\nmol–1? Justify your answer.\\\\nSolution\\\\nIt will be more close to 575 kJ mol–1. The\\\\nvalue for Al should be lower than that of\\\\nMg because of effective shielding of 3 p\\\\nelectrons from the nucleus by\\\\n3 s -electrons.\\\\n(d)Electron Gain Enthalpy\\\\nWhen an electron is added to a neutral gaseous\\\\natom (X) to convert it into a negative ion, the\\\\nenthalpy change accompanying the process is\\\\ndefined as the Electron Gain Enthalpy (∆ egH ).\\\\nElectron gain enthalpy provides a measure of\\\\nthe ease with which an atom adds an electron\\\\nto form anion as represented by equation 3.3.\\\\nX(g) + e– → X–(g) (3.3)\\\\nDepending on the element, the process of\\\\nadding an electron to the atom can be either\\\\nendothermic or exothermic. For many elements\\\\nenergy is released when an electron is added\\\\nto the atom and the electron gain enthalpy is\\\\nnegative. For example, group 17 elements (the\\\\nhalogens) have very high negative electron gain\\\\nenthalpies because they can attain stable noble\\\\ngas electronic configurations by picking up an\\\\nelectron. On the other hand, noble gases have\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 91\\\\n\\\\n92 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nwidely used is the Pauling scale.

The attraction\\\\nbetween the outer (or valence) Fig. 3.7 The periodic trends of elements in the periodic table\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 93\\\\n\\\\nNon-metallic elements have strong tendency\\\\nto gain electrons. Therefore, electronegativity\\\\nis directly related to that non-metallic\\\\nproperties of elements. It can be further\\\\nextended to say that the electronegativity is\\\\ninversely related to the metallic properties of\\\\nelements. Thus, the increase in\\\\nelectronegativities across a period is\\\\naccompanied by an increase in non-metallic\\\\nproperties (or decrease in metallic properties)\\\\nof elements. Similarly, the decrease in\\\\nelectronegativity down a group is accompanied\\\\nby a decrease in non-metallic properties (or\\\\nincrease in metallic properties) of elements.\\\\nAll these periodic trends are summarised\\\\nin figure 3.7.\\\\n3.7.2 Periodic Trends in Chemical\\\\nProperties\\\\nMost of the trends in chemical properties of\\\\nelements, such as diagonal relationships, inert\\\\npair effect, effects of lanthanoid contraction etc.\\\\nwill be dealt with along the discussion of each\\\\ngroup in later units. In this section we shall\\\\nstudy the periodicity of the valence state shown\\\\nby elements and the anomalous properties of\\\\nthe second period elements (from lithium to\\\\nfluorine).\\\\n(a) Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation\\\\nStates\\\\nThe valence is the most characteristic property\\\\nof the elements and can be understood in terms\\\\nof their electronic configurations. The valence\\\\nof representative elements is usually (though\\\\nnot necessarily) equal to the number of\\\\nelectrons in the outermost orbitals and / or\\\\nequal to eight minus the number of outermost\\\\nelectrons as shown below.\\\\nNowadays the term oxidation state is\\\\nfrequently used for valence. Consider the two\\\\noxygen containing compounds: OF 2 and Na 2 O.\\\\nThe order of electronegativity of the three\\\\nelements involved in these compounds is F >\\\\nO > Na. Each of the atoms of fluorine, with outer\\\\nGroup 1 2 13 14 15 16 17 18\\\\nNumber of valence 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\\\nelectron\\\\nValence 1 2 3 4 3,5 2,6 1,7 0,8\\\\nelectronic configuration 2 s^22 p^5 , shares one\\\\nelectron with oxygen in the OF 2 molecule. Being\\\\nhighest electronegative element, fluorine is\\\\ngiven oxidation state –1. Since there are two\\\\nfluorine atoms in this molecule, oxygen with\\\\nouter electronic configuration 2 s^22 p^4 shares\\\\ntwo electrons with fluorine atoms and thereby\\\\nexhibits oxidation state +2. In Na 2 O, oxygen\\\\nbeing more electronegative accepts two\\\\nelectrons, one from each of the two sodium\\\\natoms and, thus, shows oxidation state –2. On\\\\nthe other hand sodium with electronic\\\\nconfiguration 3 s^1 loses one electron to oxygen\\\\nand is given oxidation state +1. Thus, the\\\\noxidation state of an element in a particular\\\\ncompound can be defined as the charge\\\\nacquired by its atom on the basis of\\\\nelectronegative consideration from other atoms\\\\nin the molecule.\\\\nProblem 3.8\\\\nUsing the Periodic Table, predict the\\\\nformulas of compounds which might be\\\\nformed by the following pairs of elements;\\\\n(a) silicon and bromine (b) aluminium and\\\\nsulphur.\\\\nSolution\\\\n(a) Silicon is group 14 element with a\\\\nvalence of 4; bromine belongs to the\\\\nhalogen family with a valence of 1.\\\\nHence the formula of the compound\\\\nformed would be SiBr4.\\\\n(b)Aluminium belongs to group 13 with\\\\na valence of 3; sulphur belongs to\\\\ngroup 16 elements with a valence of\\\\n2. Hence, the formula of the compound\\\\nformed would be Al 2 S3.\\\\n\\\\nSome periodic trends observed in the\\\\nvalence of elements (hydrides and oxides) are\\\\nshown in Table 3.9. Other such periodic trends\\\\nwhich occur in the chemical behaviour of the\\\\nelements are discussed elsewhere in this book.\\\\n\\\\n94 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nThere are many elements which exhibit variable\\\\nvalence. This is particularly characteristic of\\\\ntransition elements and actinoids, which we\\\\nshall study later.\\\\n\\\\n(b) Anomalous Properties of Second Period\\\\nElements\\\\n\\\\nThe first element of each of the groups 1\\\\n(lithium) and 2 (beryllium) and groups 13-17\\\\n(boron to fluorine) differs in many respects from\\\\nthe other members of their respective group.\\\\nFor example, lithium unlike other alkali metals,\\\\nand beryllium unlike other alkaline earth\\\\nmetals, form compounds with pronounced\\\\ncovalent character; the other members of these\\\\ngroups predominantly form ionic compounds.\\\\nIn fact the behaviour of lithium and beryllium\\\\nis more similar with the second element of the\\\\n\\\\n−, whereas the other members\\\\nof the groups can expand their\\\\nvalence shell to accommodate\\\\nmore than four pairs of electrons\\\\ne.g., aluminium AlF 6\\\\n3\\\\n[ ]\\\\n−\\\\nforms).\\\\nFurthermore, the first member of\\\\np -block elements displays greater\\\\nability to form p π – p π multiple bonds\\\\nto itself (e.g., C = C, C ≡ C, N = N,\\\\nN ≡ Ν) and to other second period\\\\nelements (e.g., C = O, C = N, C ≡ N,\\\\nN = O) compared to subsequent\\\\nmembers of the same group.\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 95\\\\n\\\\nProblem 3.9\\\\nAre the oxidation state and covalency of\\\\nAl in [AlCl(H 2 O) 5 ]\\\\n2+\\\\nsame?\\\\nSolution\\\\nNo. The oxidation state of Al is +3 and the\\\\ncovalency is 6.\\\\n3.7.3 Periodic Trends and Chemical\\\\nReactivity\\\\n\\\\nWe have observed the periodic trends in certain\\\\nfundamental properties such as atomic and\\\\nionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain\\\\nenthalpy and valence. We know by now that\\\\nthe periodicity is related to electronic\\\\nconfiguration. That is, all chemical and\\\\nphysical properties are a manifestation of the\\\\nelectronic configuration of elements. We shall\\\\nnow try to explore relationships between these\\\\nfundamental properties of elements with their\\\\nchemical reactivity.\\\\n\\\\nThe atomic and ionic radii, as we know,\\\\ngenerally decrease in a period from left to right.\\\\nAs a consequence, the ionization enthalpies\\\\ngenerally increase (with some exceptions as\\\\noutlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain\\\\nenthalpies become more negative across a\\\\nperiod. In other words, the ionization enthalpy\\\\nof the extreme left element in a period is the\\\\nleast and the electron gain enthalpy of the\\\\nelement on the extreme right is the highest\\\\nnegative (note : noble gases having completely\\\\nfilled shells have rather positive electron gain\\\\nenthalpy values). This results into high\\\\nchemical reactivity at the two extremes and the\\\\nlowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum\\\\nchemical reactivity at the extreme left (among\\\\nalkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an\\\\nelectron leading to the formation of a cation\\\\nand at the extreme right (among halogens)\\\\nshown by the gain of an electron forming an\\\\nanion. This property can be related with the\\\\nreducing and oxidizing behaviour of the\\\\nelements which you will learn later. However,\\\\nhere it can be directly related to the metallic\\\\nand non-metallic character of elements. Thus,\\\\nthe metallic character of an element, which is\\\\nhighest at the extremely left decreases and the\\\\n\\\\n96 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nThus, the metallic character increases down\\\\nthe group and non-metallic character\\\\ndecreases. This trend can be related with their\\\\nreducing and oxidizing property which you\\\\n\\\\nwill learn later. In the case of transition\\\\nelements, however, a reverse trend is observed.\\\\nThis can be explained in terms of atomic size\\\\nand ionization enthalpy.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n\\\\n3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?\\\\n3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic\\\\ntable and did he stick to that?\\\\n3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law\\\\nand the Modern Periodic Law?\\\\n3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic\\\\ntable should have 32 elements.\\\\n\\\\nSUMMARY\\\\n\\\\nIn this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic\\\\nTable. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table\\\\narranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows\\\\n(periods) and eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period\\\\nare consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same\\\\ngroup have similar valence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar\\\\nchemical properties. However, the elements of the same period have incrementally\\\\nincreasing number of electrons from left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies.\\\\nFour types of elements can be recognized in the periodic table on the basis of their\\\\nelectronic configurations. These are s -block, p -block, d -block and f -block elements.\\\\nHydrogen with one electron in the 1 s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic\\\\ntable. Metals comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. Non-\\\\nmetals, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number.\\\\nElements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As)\\\\nare called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character increases with increasing atomic\\\\nnumber in a group whereas decreases from left to right in a period. The physical and\\\\nchemical properties of elements vary periodically with their atomic numbers.\\\\nPeriodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron\\\\ngain enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going\\\\nfrom left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization\\\\nenthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity\\\\nalso shows a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative\\\\nacross a period and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for\\\\nexample, among representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of\\\\nelectrons in the outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is\\\\nhighest at the two extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the\\\\nleft extreme of a period is because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy).\\\\nHighly reactive elements do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the\\\\ncombined form. Oxides formed of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements\\\\non the right are acidic in nature. Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or\\\\nneutral.\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 97\\\\n\\\\n3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?\\\\n3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth\\\\ngroup of the periodic table.\\\\n3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by\\\\n(i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory\\\\n(ii) Seaborg’s group?\\\\n3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?\\\\n3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?\\\\n3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

We know by now that\\\\nthe periodicity is related to electronic\\\\nconfiguration. That is, all chemical and\\\\nphysical properties are a manifestation of the\\\\nelectronic configuration of elements. We shall\\\\nnow try to explore relationships between these\\\\nfundamental properties of elements with their\\\\nchemical reactivity.\\\\n\\\\nThe atomic and ionic radii, as we know,\\\\ngenerally decrease in a period from left to right.\\\\nAs a consequence, the ionization enthalpies\\\\ngenerally increase (with some exceptions as\\\\noutlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain\\\\nenthalpies become more negative across a\\\\nperiod. In other words, the ionization enthalpy\\\\nof the extreme left element in a period is the\\\\nleast and the electron gain enthalpy of the\\\\nelement on the extreme right is the highest\\\\nnegative (note : noble gases having completely\\\\nfilled shells have rather positive electron gain\\\\nenthalpy values). This results into high\\\\nchemical reactivity at the two extremes and the\\\\nlowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum\\\\nchemical reactivity at the extreme left (among\\\\nalkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an\\\\nelectron leading to the formation of a cation\\\\nand at the extreme right (among halogens)\\\\nshown by the gain of an electron forming an\\\\nanion. This property can be related with the\\\\nreducing and oxidizing behaviour of the\\\\nelements which you will learn later. However,\\\\nhere it can be directly related to the metallic\\\\nand non-metallic character of elements. Thus,\\\\nthe metallic character of an element, which is\\\\nhighest at the extremely left decreases and the\\\\n\\\\n96 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nThus, the metallic character increases down\\\\nthe group and non-metallic character\\\\ndecreases. This trend can be related with their\\\\nreducing and oxidizing property which you\\\\n\\\\nwill learn later. In the case of transition\\\\nelements, however, a reverse trend is observed.\\\\nThis can be explained in terms of atomic size\\\\nand ionization enthalpy.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n\\\\n3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?\\\\n3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic\\\\ntable and did he stick to that?\\\\n3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law\\\\nand the Modern Periodic Law?\\\\n3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic\\\\ntable should have 32 elements.\\\\n\\\\nSUMMARY\\\\n\\\\nIn this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic\\\\nTable. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table\\\\narranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows\\\\n(periods) and eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period\\\\nare consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same\\\\ngroup have similar valence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar\\\\nchemical properties. However, the elements of the same period have incrementally\\\\nincreasing number of electrons from left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies.\\\\nFour types of elements can be recognized in the periodic table on the basis of their\\\\nelectronic configurations. These are s -block, p -block, d -block and f -block elements.\\\\nHydrogen with one electron in the 1 s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic\\\\ntable. Metals comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. Non-\\\\nmetals, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number.\\\\nElements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As)\\\\nare called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character increases with increasing atomic\\\\nnumber in a group whereas decreases from left to right in a period. The physical and\\\\nchemical properties of elements vary periodically with their atomic numbers.\\\\nPeriodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron\\\\ngain enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going\\\\nfrom left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization\\\\nenthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity\\\\nalso shows a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative\\\\nacross a period and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for\\\\nexample, among representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of\\\\nelectrons in the outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is\\\\nhighest at the two extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the\\\\nleft extreme of a period is because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy).\\\\nHighly reactive elements do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the\\\\ncombined form. Oxides formed of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements\\\\non the right are acidic in nature. Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or\\\\nneutral.\\\\n\\\\nCLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIES 97\\\\n\\\\n3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?\\\\n3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth\\\\ngroup of the periodic table.\\\\n3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by\\\\n(i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory\\\\n(ii) Seaborg’s group?\\\\n3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?\\\\n3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?\\\\n3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

However,\\\\na group of atoms is found to exist together as one species\\\\nhaving characteristic properties. Such a group of atoms is\\\\ncalled a molecule. Obviously there must be some force\\\\nwhich holds these constituent atoms together in the\\\\nmolecules. The attractive force which holds various\\\\nconstituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together in different\\\\nchemical species is called a chemical bond. Since the\\\\nformation of chemical compounds takes place as a result\\\\nof combination of atoms of various elements in different\\\\nways, it raises many questions. Why do atoms combine?\\\\nWhy are only certain combinations possible? Why do some\\\\natoms combine while certain others do not? Why do\\\\nmolecules possess definite shapes? To answer such\\\\nquestions different theories and concepts have been put\\\\nforward from time to time. These are Kössel-Lewis\\\\napproach, Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)\\\\nTheory, Valence Bond (VB) Theory and Molecular Orbital\\\\n(MO) Theory. The evolution of various theories of valence\\\\nand the interpretation of the nature of chemical bonds have\\\\nclosely been related to the developments in the\\\\nunderstanding of the structure of atom, the electronic\\\\nconfiguration of elements and the periodic table. Every\\\\nsystem tends to be more stable and bonding is nature’s\\\\nway of lowering the energy of the system to attain stability.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^101\\\\n\\\\n4.1 Kössel-Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding\\\\n\\\\nIn order to explain the formation of chemical\\\\nbond in terms of electrons, a number of\\\\nattempts were made, but it was only in 1916\\\\nwhen Kössel and Lewis succeeded\\\\nindependently in giving a satisfactory\\\\nexplanation. They were the first to provide\\\\nsome logical explanation of valence which was\\\\nbased on the inertness of noble gases.\\\\nLewis pictured the atom in terms of a\\\\npositively charged ‘Kernel’ (the nucleus plus\\\\nthe inner electrons) and the outer shell that\\\\ncould accommodate a maximum of eight\\\\nelectrons. He, further assumed that these\\\\neight electrons occupy the corners of a cube\\\\nwhich surround the ‘Kernel’. Thus the single\\\\nouter shell electron of sodium would occupy\\\\none corner of the cube, while in the case of a\\\\nnoble gas all the eight corners would be\\\\noccupied. This octet of electrons, represents\\\\na particularly stable electronic arrangement.\\\\nLewis postulated that atoms achieve the\\\\nstable octet when they are linked by\\\\nchemical bonds. In the case of sodium and\\\\nchlorine, this can happen by the transfer of\\\\nan electron from sodium to chlorine thereby\\\\ngiving the Na+ and Cl\\\\n-\\\\n    ions. In the case of\\\\nother molecules like Cl 2 , H 2 , F 2 , etc., the bond\\\\nis formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons\\\\nbetween the atoms. In the process each atom\\\\nattains a stable outer octet of electrons.\\\\nLewis Symbols: In the formation of a\\\\nmolecule, only the outer shell electrons take\\\\npart in chemical combination and they are\\\\nknown as valence electrons. The inner shell\\\\nelectrons are well protected and are generally\\\\nnot involved in the combination process.\\\\nG.N. Lewis, an American chemist introduced\\\\nsimple notations to represent valence\\\\nelectrons in an atom. These notations are\\\\ncalled Lewis symbols. For example, the Lewis\\\\nsymbols for the elements of second period are\\\\nas under:\\\\n\\\\n102 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nthe electrovalent bond. The electrovalence\\\\nis thus equal to the number of unit\\\\ncharge(s) on the ion. Thus, calcium is\\\\nassigned a positive electrovalence of two,\\\\nwhile chlorine a negative electrovalence of\\\\none.\\\\n\\\\nKössel’s postulations provide the basis for\\\\nthe modern concepts regarding ion-formation\\\\nby electron transfer and the formation of ionic\\\\ncrystalline compounds. His views have proved\\\\nto be of great value in the understanding and\\\\nsystematisation of the ionic compounds. At\\\\nthe same time he did recognise the fact that\\\\na large number of compounds did not fit into\\\\nthese concepts.\\\\n\\\\n4.1.1 Octet Rule\\\\n\\\\nKössel and Lewis in 1916 developed an\\\\nimportant theory of chemical combination\\\\nbetween atoms known as electronic theory\\\\nof chemical bonding. According to this,\\\\natoms can combine either by transfer of\\\\nvalence electrons from one atom to another\\\\n(gaining or losing) or by sharing of valence\\\\nelectrons in order to have an octet in their\\\\nvalence shells. This is known as octet rule.\\\\n\\\\n4.1.2 Covalent Bond\\\\n\\\\nLangmuir (1919) refined the Lewis\\\\npostulations by abandoning the idea of the\\\\nstationary cubical arrangement of the octet,\\\\nand by introducing the term covalent bond.\\\\nThe Lewis-Langmuir theory can be\\\\nunderstood by considering the formation of\\\\nthe chlorine molecule,Cl 2. The Cl atom with\\\\nelectronic configuration, [Ne]3 s^2 3 p^5 , is one\\\\nelectron short of the argon configuration.\\\\nThe formation of the Cl 2 molecule can be\\\\nunderstood in terms of the sharing of a pair\\\\nof electrons between the two chlorine atoms,\\\\neach chlorine atom contributing one electron\\\\nto the shared pair. In the process both\\\\n\\\\nchlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of\\\\nthe nearest noble gas (i.e., argon).\\\\nThe dots represent electrons. Such\\\\nstructures are referred to as Lewis dot\\\\nstructures.\\\\nThe Lewis dot structures can be written\\\\nfor other molecules also, in which the\\\\ncombining atoms may be identical or\\\\ndifferent. The important conditions being that:\\\\n- Each bond is formed as a result of sharing\\\\n    of an electron pair between the atoms.\\\\n- Each combining atom contributes at least\\\\n    one electron to the shared pair.\\\\n- The combining atoms attain the outer-\\\\n    shell noble gas configurations as a result\\\\n    of the sharing of electrons.\\\\n- Thus in water and carbon tetrachloride\\\\n    molecules, formation of covalent bonds\\\\n    can be represented as:\\\\n\\\\nor Cl – Cl\\\\n\\\\nCovalent bond between two Cl atoms\\\\n\\\\nThus, when two atoms share one\\\\nelectron pair they are said to be joined by\\\\na single covalent bond. In many compounds\\\\nwe have multiple bonds between atoms. The\\\\nformation of multiple bonds envisages\\\\nsharing of more than one electron pair\\\\nbetween two atoms. If two atoms share two\\\\npairs of electrons, the covalent bond\\\\nbetween them is called a double bond. For\\\\nexample, in the carbon dioxide molecule, we\\\\nhave two double bonds between the carbon\\\\nand oxygen atoms. Similarly in ethene\\\\nmolecule the two carbon atoms are joined by\\\\na double bond.\\\\nDouble bonds in CO 2 molecule\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^103\\\\n\\\\nWhen combining atoms share three\\\\nelectron pairs as in the case of two\\\\nnitrogen atoms in the N 2 molecule and the\\\\ntwo carbon atoms in the ethyne molecule,\\\\na triple bond is formed.\\\\n4.1.3 Lewis Representation of Simple\\\\nMolecules (the Lewis Structures)\\\\nThe Lewis dot structures provide a picture\\\\nof bonding in molecules and ions in terms\\\\nof the shared pairs of electrons and the\\\\noctet rule. While such a picture may not\\\\nexplain the bonding and behaviour of a\\\\nmolecule completely, it does help in\\\\nunderstanding the formation and properties\\\\nof a molecule to a large extent. Writing of\\\\nLewis dot structures of molecules is,\\\\ntherefore, very useful. The Lewis dot\\\\nstructures can be written by adopting the\\\\nfollowing steps:\\\\n- The total number of electrons required for\\\\n    writing the structures are obtained by\\\\n    adding the valence electrons of the\\\\n    combining atoms. For example, in the CH 4\\\\n    molecule there are eight valence electrons\\\\n    available for bonding (4 from carbon and\\\\n    4 from the four hydrogen atoms).\\\\n- For anions, each negative charge would\\\\n    mean addition of one electron. For\\\\n    cations, each positive charge would result\\\\n\\\\nin subtraction of one electron from the total\\\\nnumber of valence electrons. For example,\\\\nfor the CO 3 2– ion, the two negative charges\\\\nindicate that there are two additional\\\\nelectrons than those provided by the\\\\nneutral atoms. For NH 4 + ion, one positive\\\\ncharge indicates the loss of one electron\\\\nfrom the group of neutral atoms.\\\\n- Knowing the chemical symbols of the\\\\n    combining atoms and having knowledge\\\\n    of the skeletal structure of the compound\\\\n    (known or guessed intelligently), it is easy\\\\n    to distribute the total number of electrons\\\\n    as bonding shared pairs between the\\\\n    atoms in proportion to the total bonds.\\\\n- In general the least electronegative atom\\\\n    occupies the central position in the\\\\n    molecule/ion. For example in the NF 3 and\\\\n    CO 3 2–, nitrogen and carbon are the central\\\\n    atoms whereas fluorine and oxygen\\\\n    occupy the terminal positions.\\\\n- After accounting for the shared pairs of\\\\n    electrons for single bonds, the remaining\\\\n    electron pairs are either utilized for multiple\\\\n    bonding or remain as the lone pairs. The\\\\n    basic requirement being that each bonded\\\\n    atom gets an octet of electrons.\\\\n    Lewis representations of a few molecules/\\\\n    ions are given in Table 4.1.\\\\n\\\\nTable 4.1The Lewis Representation of Some\\\\nMolecules\\\\n* Each H atom attains the configuration of helium (a duplet\\\\nof electrons)\\\\nC 2 H 4 molecule\\\\nN 2 molecule\\\\nC 2 H 2 molecule\\\\n\\\\n104 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\ntotal number of valence\\\\nelectrons in the free\\\\natom\\\\n—\\\\ntotal number of non\\\\nbonding (lone pair)\\\\nelectrons\\\\n— (1/2)\\\\ntotal number of\\\\nbonding(shared)\\\\nelectrons\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^105\\\\n\\\\n4.1.5 Limitations of the Octet Rule\\\\nThe octet rule, though useful, is not universal.\\\\nIt is quite useful for understanding the\\\\nstructures of most of the organic compounds\\\\nand it applies mainly to the second period\\\\nelements of the periodic table. There are three\\\\ntypes of exceptions to the octet rule.\\\\nThe incomplete octet of the central atom\\\\nIn some compounds, the number of electrons\\\\nsurrounding the central atom is less than\\\\neight. This is especially the case with elements\\\\nhaving less than four valence electrons.\\\\nExamples are LiCl, BeH 2 and BCl 3.\\\\nLi, Be and B have 1,2 and 3 valence electrons\\\\nonly. Some other such compounds are AlCl 3\\\\nand BF 3.\\\\nOdd-electron molecules\\\\nIn molecules with an odd number of electrons\\\\nlike nitric oxide, NO and nitrogen dioxide,\\\\nNO 2 , the octet rule is not satisfied for all the\\\\natoms\\\\nThe expanded octet\\\\nElements in and beyond the third period of\\\\nthe periodic table have, apart from 3 s and 3 p\\\\norbitals, 3 d orbitals also available for bonding.\\\\nIn a number of compounds of these elements\\\\nthere are more than eight valence electrons\\\\naround the central atom. This is termed as\\\\nthe expanded octet. Obviously the octet rule\\\\ndoes not apply in such cases.\\\\nSome of the examples of such compounds\\\\nare: PF 5 , SF 6 , H 2 SO 4 and a number of\\\\ncoordination compounds.\\\\nThe counting is based on the assumption\\\\nthat the atom in the molecule owns one\\\\nelectron of each shared pair and both the\\\\nelectrons of a lone pair.\\\\nLet us consider the ozone molecule (O 3 ).\\\\nThe Lewis structure of O 3 may be drawn as :\\\\nThe atoms have been numbered as 1, 2\\\\nand 3.

However,\\\\na group of atoms is found to exist together as one species\\\\nhaving characteristic properties. Such a group of atoms is\\\\ncalled a molecule. Obviously there must be some force\\\\nwhich holds these constituent atoms together in the\\\\nmolecules. The attractive force which holds various\\\\nconstituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together in different\\\\nchemical species is called a chemical bond. Since the\\\\nformation of chemical compounds takes place as a result\\\\nof combination of atoms of various elements in different\\\\nways, it raises many questions. Why do atoms combine?\\\\nWhy are only certain combinations possible? Why do some\\\\natoms combine while certain others do not? Why do\\\\nmolecules possess definite shapes? To answer such\\\\nquestions different theories and concepts have been put\\\\nforward from time to time. These are Kössel-Lewis\\\\napproach, Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)\\\\nTheory, Valence Bond (VB) Theory and Molecular Orbital\\\\n(MO) Theory. The evolution of various theories of valence\\\\nand the interpretation of the nature of chemical bonds have\\\\nclosely been related to the developments in the\\\\nunderstanding of the structure of atom, the electronic\\\\nconfiguration of elements and the periodic table. Every\\\\nsystem tends to be more stable and bonding is nature’s\\\\nway of lowering the energy of the system to attain stability.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^101\\\\n\\\\n4.1 Kössel-Lewis Approach to Chemical Bonding\\\\n\\\\nIn order to explain the formation of chemical\\\\nbond in terms of electrons, a number of\\\\nattempts were made, but it was only in 1916\\\\nwhen Kössel and Lewis succeeded\\\\nindependently in giving a satisfactory\\\\nexplanation. They were the first to provide\\\\nsome logical explanation of valence which was\\\\nbased on the inertness of noble gases.\\\\nLewis pictured the atom in terms of a\\\\npositively charged ‘Kernel’ (the nucleus plus\\\\nthe inner electrons) and the outer shell that\\\\ncould accommodate a maximum of eight\\\\nelectrons. He, further assumed that these\\\\neight electrons occupy the corners of a cube\\\\nwhich surround the ‘Kernel’. Thus the single\\\\nouter shell electron of sodium would occupy\\\\none corner of the cube, while in the case of a\\\\nnoble gas all the eight corners would be\\\\noccupied. This octet of electrons, represents\\\\na particularly stable electronic arrangement.\\\\nLewis postulated that atoms achieve the\\\\nstable octet when they are linked by\\\\nchemical bonds. In the case of sodium and\\\\nchlorine, this can happen by the transfer of\\\\nan electron from sodium to chlorine thereby\\\\ngiving the Na+ and Cl\\\\n-\\\\n    ions. In the case of\\\\nother molecules like Cl 2 , H 2 , F 2 , etc., the bond\\\\nis formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons\\\\nbetween the atoms. In the process each atom\\\\nattains a stable outer octet of electrons.\\\\nLewis Symbols: In the formation of a\\\\nmolecule, only the outer shell electrons take\\\\npart in chemical combination and they are\\\\nknown as valence electrons. The inner shell\\\\nelectrons are well protected and are generally\\\\nnot involved in the combination process.\\\\nG.N. Lewis, an American chemist introduced\\\\nsimple notations to represent valence\\\\nelectrons in an atom. These notations are\\\\ncalled Lewis symbols. For example, the Lewis\\\\nsymbols for the elements of second period are\\\\nas under:\\\\n\\\\n102 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nthe electrovalent bond. The electrovalence\\\\nis thus equal to the number of unit\\\\ncharge(s) on the ion. Thus, calcium is\\\\nassigned a positive electrovalence of two,\\\\nwhile chlorine a negative electrovalence of\\\\none.\\\\n\\\\nKössel’s postulations provide the basis for\\\\nthe modern concepts regarding ion-formation\\\\nby electron transfer and the formation of ionic\\\\ncrystalline compounds. His views have proved\\\\nto be of great value in the understanding and\\\\nsystematisation of the ionic compounds. At\\\\nthe same time he did recognise the fact that\\\\na large number of compounds did not fit into\\\\nthese concepts.\\\\n\\\\n4.1.1 Octet Rule\\\\n\\\\nKössel and Lewis in 1916 developed an\\\\nimportant theory of chemical combination\\\\nbetween atoms known as electronic theory\\\\nof chemical bonding. According to this,\\\\natoms can combine either by transfer of\\\\nvalence electrons from one atom to another\\\\n(gaining or losing) or by sharing of valence\\\\nelectrons in order to have an octet in their\\\\nvalence shells. This is known as octet rule.\\\\n\\\\n4.1.2 Covalent Bond\\\\n\\\\nLangmuir (1919) refined the Lewis\\\\npostulations by abandoning the idea of the\\\\nstationary cubical arrangement of the octet,\\\\nand by introducing the term covalent bond.\\\\nThe Lewis-Langmuir theory can be\\\\nunderstood by considering the formation of\\\\nthe chlorine molecule,Cl 2. The Cl atom with\\\\nelectronic configuration, [Ne]3 s^2 3 p^5 , is one\\\\nelectron short of the argon configuration.\\\\nThe formation of the Cl 2 molecule can be\\\\nunderstood in terms of the sharing of a pair\\\\nof electrons between the two chlorine atoms,\\\\neach chlorine atom contributing one electron\\\\nto the shared pair. In the process both\\\\n\\\\nchlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of\\\\nthe nearest noble gas (i.e., argon).\\\\nThe dots represent electrons. Such\\\\nstructures are referred to as Lewis dot\\\\nstructures.\\\\nThe Lewis dot structures can be written\\\\nfor other molecules also, in which the\\\\ncombining atoms may be identical or\\\\ndifferent. The important conditions being that:\\\\n- Each bond is formed as a result of sharing\\\\n    of an electron pair between the atoms.\\\\n- Each combining atom contributes at least\\\\n    one electron to the shared pair.\\\\n- The combining atoms attain the outer-\\\\n    shell noble gas configurations as a result\\\\n    of the sharing of electrons.\\\\n- Thus in water and carbon tetrachloride\\\\n    molecules, formation of covalent bonds\\\\n    can be represented as:\\\\n\\\\nor Cl – Cl\\\\n\\\\nCovalent bond between two Cl atoms\\\\n\\\\nThus, when two atoms share one\\\\nelectron pair they are said to be joined by\\\\na single covalent bond. In many compounds\\\\nwe have multiple bonds between atoms. The\\\\nformation of multiple bonds envisages\\\\nsharing of more than one electron pair\\\\nbetween two atoms. If two atoms share two\\\\npairs of electrons, the covalent bond\\\\nbetween them is called a double bond. For\\\\nexample, in the carbon dioxide molecule, we\\\\nhave two double bonds between the carbon\\\\nand oxygen atoms. Similarly in ethene\\\\nmolecule the two carbon atoms are joined by\\\\na double bond.\\\\nDouble bonds in CO 2 molecule\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^103\\\\n\\\\nWhen combining atoms share three\\\\nelectron pairs as in the case of two\\\\nnitrogen atoms in the N 2 molecule and the\\\\ntwo carbon atoms in the ethyne molecule,\\\\na triple bond is formed.\\\\n4.1.3 Lewis Representation of Simple\\\\nMolecules (the Lewis Structures)\\\\nThe Lewis dot structures provide a picture\\\\nof bonding in molecules and ions in terms\\\\nof the shared pairs of electrons and the\\\\noctet rule. While such a picture may not\\\\nexplain the bonding and behaviour of a\\\\nmolecule completely, it does help in\\\\nunderstanding the formation and properties\\\\nof a molecule to a large extent. Writing of\\\\nLewis dot structures of molecules is,\\\\ntherefore, very useful. The Lewis dot\\\\nstructures can be written by adopting the\\\\nfollowing steps:\\\\n- The total number of electrons required for\\\\n    writing the structures are obtained by\\\\n    adding the valence electrons of the\\\\n    combining atoms. For example, in the CH 4\\\\n    molecule there are eight valence electrons\\\\n    available for bonding (4 from carbon and\\\\n    4 from the four hydrogen atoms).\\\\n- For anions, each negative charge would\\\\n    mean addition of one electron. For\\\\n    cations, each positive charge would result\\\\n\\\\nin subtraction of one electron from the total\\\\nnumber of valence electrons. For example,\\\\nfor the CO 3 2– ion, the two negative charges\\\\nindicate that there are two additional\\\\nelectrons than those provided by the\\\\nneutral atoms. For NH 4 + ion, one positive\\\\ncharge indicates the loss of one electron\\\\nfrom the group of neutral atoms.\\\\n- Knowing the chemical symbols of the\\\\n    combining atoms and having knowledge\\\\n    of the skeletal structure of the compound\\\\n    (known or guessed intelligently), it is easy\\\\n    to distribute the total number of electrons\\\\n    as bonding shared pairs between the\\\\n    atoms in proportion to the total bonds.\\\\n- In general the least electronegative atom\\\\n    occupies the central position in the\\\\n    molecule/ion. For example in the NF 3 and\\\\n    CO 3 2–, nitrogen and carbon are the central\\\\n    atoms whereas fluorine and oxygen\\\\n    occupy the terminal positions.\\\\n- After accounting for the shared pairs of\\\\n    electrons for single bonds, the remaining\\\\n    electron pairs are either utilized for multiple\\\\n    bonding or remain as the lone pairs. The\\\\n    basic requirement being that each bonded\\\\n    atom gets an octet of electrons.\\\\n    Lewis representations of a few molecules/\\\\n    ions are given in Table 4.1.\\\\n\\\\nTable 4.1The Lewis Representation of Some\\\\nMolecules\\\\n* Each H atom attains the configuration of helium (a duplet\\\\nof electrons)\\\\nC 2 H 4 molecule\\\\nN 2 molecule\\\\nC 2 H 2 molecule\\\\n\\\\n104 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\ntotal number of valence\\\\nelectrons in the free\\\\natom\\\\n—\\\\ntotal number of non\\\\nbonding (lone pair)\\\\nelectrons\\\\n— (1/2)\\\\ntotal number of\\\\nbonding(shared)\\\\nelectrons\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^105\\\\n\\\\n4.1.5 Limitations of the Octet Rule\\\\nThe octet rule, though useful, is not universal.\\\\nIt is quite useful for understanding the\\\\nstructures of most of the organic compounds\\\\nand it applies mainly to the second period\\\\nelements of the periodic table. There are three\\\\ntypes of exceptions to the octet rule.\\\\nThe incomplete octet of the central atom\\\\nIn some compounds, the number of electrons\\\\nsurrounding the central atom is less than\\\\neight. This is especially the case with elements\\\\nhaving less than four valence electrons.\\\\nExamples are LiCl, BeH 2 and BCl 3.\\\\nLi, Be and B have 1,2 and 3 valence electrons\\\\nonly. Some other such compounds are AlCl 3\\\\nand BF 3.\\\\nOdd-electron molecules\\\\nIn molecules with an odd number of electrons\\\\nlike nitric oxide, NO and nitrogen dioxide,\\\\nNO 2 , the octet rule is not satisfied for all the\\\\natoms\\\\nThe expanded octet\\\\nElements in and beyond the third period of\\\\nthe periodic table have, apart from 3 s and 3 p\\\\norbitals, 3 d orbitals also available for bonding.\\\\nIn a number of compounds of these elements\\\\nthere are more than eight valence electrons\\\\naround the central atom. This is termed as\\\\nthe expanded octet. Obviously the octet rule\\\\ndoes not apply in such cases.\\\\nSome of the examples of such compounds\\\\nare: PF 5 , SF 6 , H 2 SO 4 and a number of\\\\ncoordination compounds.\\\\nThe counting is based on the assumption\\\\nthat the atom in the molecule owns one\\\\nelectron of each shared pair and both the\\\\nelectrons of a lone pair.\\\\nLet us consider the ozone molecule (O 3 ).\\\\nThe Lewis structure of O 3 may be drawn as :\\\\nThe atoms have been numbered as 1, 2\\\\nand 3. The formal charge on:\\\\n- The central O atom marked 1\\\\n\\\\n= 6 – 2 –\\\\n\\\\n(6) = +1\\\\n\\\\nThe end O atom marked 2\\\\n\\\\n= 6 – 4 –\\\\n\\\\n(4) = 0\\\\n\\\\nThe end O atom marked 3\\\\n\\\\n= 6 – 6 –\\\\n\\\\n(2) = –1\\\\n\\\\nHence, we represent O 3 along with the\\\\nformal charges as follows:\\\\nWe must understand that formal charges\\\\ndo not indicate real charge separation within\\\\nthe molecule. Indicating the charges on the\\\\natoms in the Lewis structure only helps in\\\\nkeeping track of the valence electrons in the\\\\nmolecule. Formal charges help in the\\\\nselection of the lowest energy structure from\\\\na number of possible Lewis structures for a\\\\ngiven species. Generally the lowest energy\\\\nstructure is the one with the smallest\\\\nformal charges on the atoms. The formal\\\\ncharge is a factor based on a pure covalent\\\\nview of bonding in which electron pairs\\\\nare shared equally by neighbouring atoms.\\\\n\\\\n106 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly, sulphur also forms many\\\\ncompounds in which the octet rule is obeyed.\\\\nIn sulphur dichloride, the S atom has an octet\\\\nof electrons around it.\\\\n\\\\nOther drawbacks of the octet theory\\\\n\\\\nIt is clear that octet rule is based upon\\\\n    the chemical inertness of noble gases.\\\\n    However, some noble gases (for example\\\\n    xenon and krypton) also combine with\\\\n    oxygen and fluorine to form a number of\\\\n    compounds like XeF 2 , KrF 2 , XeOF 2 etc.,\\\\n\\\\nThis theory does not account for the shape\\\\n    of molecules.\\\\n\\\\nIt does not explain the relative stability of\\\\n    the molecules being totally silent about\\\\n    the energy of a molecule.\\\\n\\\\n4.2 Ionic or Electrovalent Bond\\\\n\\\\nFrom the Kössel and Lewis treatment of the\\\\nformation of an ionic bond, it follows that the\\\\nformation of ionic compounds would\\\\nprimarily depend upon:\\\\n\\\\nThe ease of formation of the positive and\\\\n    negative ions from the respective neutral\\\\n    atoms;\\\\n\\\\nThe arrangement of the positive and\\\\n    negative ions in the solid, that is, the\\\\n    lattice of the crystalline compound.\\\\n    The formation of a positive ion involves\\\\nionization, i.e., removal of electron(s) from\\\\nthe neutral atom and that of the negative ion\\\\ninvolves the addition of electron(s) to the\\\\nneutral atom.\\\\n\\\\nM(g) → M+(g) + e– ;\\\\nIonization enthalpy\\\\nX(g) + e– → X –^ (g) ;\\\\nElectron gain enthalpy\\\\nM+(g) + X –(g) → MX(s)\\\\nThe electron gain enthalpy, ∆∆∆∆∆ egH , is the\\\\nenthalpy change (Unit 3), when a gas phase atom\\\\nin its ground state gains an electron. The\\\\nelectron gain process may be exothermic or\\\\nendothermic. The ionization, on the other hand,\\\\nis always endothermic. Electron affinity, is the\\\\nnegative of the energy change accompanying\\\\nelectron gain.\\\\n\\\\nObviously ionic bonds will be formed\\\\nmore easily between elements with\\\\ncomparatively low ionization enthalpies\\\\nand elements with comparatively high\\\\nnegative value of electron gain enthalpy.\\\\nMost ionic compounds have cations\\\\nderived from metallic elements and anions\\\\nfrom non-metallic elements. The\\\\nammonium ion, NH 4 + (made up of two non-\\\\nmetallic elements) is an exception. It forms\\\\nthe cation of a number of ionic compounds.\\\\nIonic compounds in the crystalline state\\\\nconsist of orderly three-dimensional\\\\narrangements of cations and anions held\\\\ntogether by coulombic interaction energies.\\\\nThese compounds crystallise in different\\\\ncrystal structures determined by the size\\\\nof the ions, their packing arrangements and\\\\nother factors. The crystal structure of\\\\nsodium chloride, NaCl (rock salt), for\\\\nexample is shown below.\\\\nIn ionic solids, the sum of the electron\\\\ngain enthalpy and the ionization enthalpy\\\\nmay be positive but still the crystal\\\\nstructure gets stabilized due to the energy\\\\nreleased in the formation of the crystal\\\\nlattice. For example: the ionization\\\\nenthalpy for Na+(g) formation from Na(g)\\\\nis 495.8 kJ mol–1 ; while the electron gain\\\\nenthalpy for the change Cl(g) + e–→\\\\nCl–^ (g) is, – 348.7 kJ mol–1 only. The sum\\\\nof the two, 147.1 kJ mol-1 is more than\\\\ncompensated for by the enthalpy of lattice\\\\nformation of NaCl(s) (–788 kJ mol–1).\\\\nTherefore, the energy released in the\\\\nRock salt structure\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^107\\\\n\\\\nprocesses is more than the energy absorbed.\\\\nThus a qualitative measure of the\\\\nstability of an ionic compound is\\\\nprovided by its enthalpy of lattice\\\\nformation and not simply by achieving\\\\noctet of electrons around the ionic species\\\\nin gaseous state.\\\\nSince lattice enthalpy plays a key role\\\\nin the formation of ionic compounds, it is\\\\nimportant that we learn more about it.\\\\n4.2.1 Lattice Enthalpy\\\\nThe Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid is\\\\ndefined as the energy required to\\\\ncompletely separate one mole of a solid\\\\nionic compound into gaseous constituent\\\\nions. For example, the lattice enthalpy of NaCl\\\\nis 788 kJ mol–1. This means that 788 kJ of\\\\nenergy is required to separate one mole of\\\\nsolid NaCl into one mole of Na+ (g) and one\\\\nmole of Cl– (g) to an infinite distance.\\\\nThis process involves both the attractive\\\\nforces between ions of opposite charges and\\\\nthe repulsive forces between ions of like\\\\ncharge. The solid crystal being three-\\\\ndimensional; it is not possible to calculate\\\\nlattice enthalpy directly from the interaction\\\\nof forces of attraction and repulsion only.\\\\nFactors associated with the crystal geometry\\\\nhave to be included.\\\\n\\\\n4.3 Bond Parameters\\\\n\\\\n4.3.1 Bond Length\\\\nBond length is defined as the equilibrium\\\\ndistance between the nuclei of two bonded\\\\natoms in a molecule. Bond lengths are\\\\nmeasured by spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction\\\\nand electron-diffraction techniques about\\\\nwhich you will learn in higher classes. Each\\\\natom of the bonded pair contributes to the\\\\nbond length (Fig. 4.1). In the case of a covalent\\\\nbond, the contribution from each atom is\\\\ncalled the covalent radius of that atom.\\\\nThe covalent radius is measured\\\\napproximately as the radius of an atom’s\\\\ncore which is in contact with the core of\\\\nan adjacent atom in a bonded situation.\\\\nThe covalent radius is half of the distance\\\\nbetween two similar atoms joined by a\\\\n\\\\nFig. 4.1 The bond length in a covalent\\\\nmolecule AB.\\\\nR = rA + rB (R is the bond length and rA and rB\\\\nare the covalent radii of atoms A and B\\\\nrespectively)\\\\ncovalent bond in the same molecule. The van\\\\nder Waals radius represents the overall size\\\\nof the atom which includes its valence shell\\\\nin a nonbonded situation. Further, the van\\\\nder Waals radius is half of the distance\\\\nbetween two similar atoms in separate\\\\nmolecules in a solid. Covalent and van der\\\\nWaals radii of chlorine are depicted in Fig.4.2\\\\nFig. 4.2 Covalent and van der Waals radii in a\\\\nchlorine molecule. The inner circles\\\\ncorrespond to the size of the chlorine atom\\\\n(rvdw and rc are van der Waals and\\\\ncovalent radii respectively).\\\\nr = 99 pmc 198 pm\\\\nr\\\\nvdw= 180 pm\\\\n360 pm\\\\n\\\\n108 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nSome typical average bond lengths for\\\\nsingle, double and triple bonds are shown in\\\\nTable 4.2. Bond lengths for some common\\\\nmolecules are given in Table 4.3.\\\\n\\\\nThe covalent radii of some common\\\\nelements are listed in Table 4.4.\\\\n\\\\n4.3.2 Bond Angle\\\\n\\\\nIt is defined as the angle between the orbitals\\\\ncontaining bonding electron pairs around the\\\\ncentral atom in a molecule/complex ion. Bond\\\\nangle is expressed in degree which can be\\\\nexperimentally determined by spectroscopic\\\\nmethods. It gives some idea regarding the\\\\ndistribution of orbitals around the central\\\\natom in a molecule/complex ion and hence it\\\\nhelps us in determining its shape. For\\\\nexample H–O–H bond angle in water can be\\\\nrepresented as under :\\\\n\\\\n4.3.3 Bond Enthalpy\\\\n\\\\nIt is defined as the amount of energy required\\\\nto break one mole of bonds of a particular\\\\ntype between two atoms in a gaseous state.\\\\nThe unit of bond enthalpy is kJ mol–1. For\\\\nexample, the H – H bond enthalpy in hydrogen\\\\nmolecule is 435.8 kJ mol–1.\\\\n\\\\nH 2 (g) → H(g) + H(g); ∆a H V = 435.8 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly the bond enthalpy for molecules\\\\ncontaining multiple bonds, for example O 2 and\\\\nN 2 will be as under :\\\\n\\\\nO 2 (O = O) (g) → O(g) + O(g);\\\\n∆a H V = 498 kJ mol–1\\\\nN 2 (N ≡ N) (g) → N(g) + N(g);\\\\n∆a H V = 946.0 kJ mol–1\\\\nIt is important that larger the bond\\\\ndissociation enthalpy, stronger will be the\\\\nbond in the molecule. For a heteronuclear\\\\ndiatomic molecules like HCl, we have\\\\n\\\\nHCl (g) → H(g) + Cl (g); ∆a H V = 431.0 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nIn case of polyatomic molecules, the\\\\nmeasurement of bond strength is more\\\\ncomplicated. For example in case of H 2 O\\\\nmolecule, the enthalpy needed to break the\\\\ntwo O – H bonds is not the same.\\\\n\\\\nTable 4.2 Average Bond Lengths for Some\\\\nSingle, Double and Triple Bonds\\\\nBond Type Covalent Bond Length\\\\n(pm)\\\\nO–H 96\\\\nC–H 107\\\\nN–O 136\\\\nC–O 143\\\\nC–N 143\\\\nC–C 154\\\\nC=O 121\\\\nN=O 122\\\\nC=C 133\\\\nC=N 138\\\\nC≡N 116\\\\nC≡C 120\\\\nTable 4.3 Bond Lengths in Some Common\\\\nMolecules\\\\nMolecule Bond Length\\\\n(pm)\\\\nH 2 (H – H) 74\\\\nF 2 (F – F) 144\\\\nCl 2 (Cl – Cl) 199\\\\nBr 2 (Br – Br) 228\\\\nI 2 (I – I) 267\\\\nN 2 (N ≡ N) 109\\\\nO 2 (O = O) 121\\\\nHF (H – F) 92\\\\nHCl (H – Cl) 127\\\\nHBr (H – Br) 141\\\\nHI (H – I) 160\\\\nTable 4.4 Covalent Radii, *rcov/(pm)\\\\n* The values cited are for single bonds, except where\\\\notherwise indicated in parenthesis.

While the lone pairs are\\\\nlocalised on the central atom, each bonded pair\\\\nis shared between two atoms. As a result, the\\\\nlone pair electrons in a molecule occupy more\\\\nspace as compared to the bonding pairs of\\\\nelectrons. This results in greater repulsion\\\\nbetween lone pairs of electrons as compared\\\\nto the lone pair - bond pair and bond pair -\\\\nbond pair repulsions. These repulsion effects\\\\n\\\\nresult in deviations from idealised shapes and\\\\nalterations in bond angles in molecules.\\\\nFor the prediction of geometrical shapes of\\\\nmolecules with the help of VSEPR theory, it is\\\\nconvenient to divide molecules into two\\\\ncategories as (i) molecules in which the\\\\ncentral atom', '= –1\\\\n\\\\nHence, we represent O 3 along with the\\\\nformal charges as follows:\\\\nWe must understand that formal charges\\\\ndo not indicate real charge separation within\\\\nthe molecule.

Formal charges help in the\\\\nselection of the lowest energy structure from\\\\na number of possible Lewis structures for a\\\\ngiven species. Generally the lowest energy\\\\nstructure is the one with the smallest\\\\nformal charges on the atoms. The formal\\\\ncharge is a factor based on a pure covalent\\\\nview of bonding in which electron pairs\\\\nare shared equally by neighbouring atoms.\\\\n\\\\n106 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly, sulphur also forms many\\\\ncompounds in which the octet rule is obeyed.\\\\nIn sulphur dichloride, the S atom has an octet\\\\nof electrons around it.\\\\n\\\\nOther drawbacks of the octet theory\\\\n\\\\nIt is clear that octet rule is based upon\\\\n    the chemical inertness of noble gases.\\\\n    However, some noble gases (for example\\\\n    xenon and krypton) also combine with\\\\n    oxygen and fluorine to form a number of\\\\n    compounds like XeF 2 , KrF 2 , XeOF 2 etc.,\\\\n\\\\nThis theory does not account for the shape\\\\n    of molecules.\\\\n\\\\nIt does not explain the relative stability of\\\\n    the molecules being totally silent about\\\\n    the energy of a molecule.\\\\n\\\\n4.2 Ionic or Electrovalent Bond\\\\n\\\\nFrom the Kössel and Lewis treatment of the\\\\nformation of an ionic bond, it follows that the\\\\nformation of ionic compounds would\\\\nprimarily depend upon:\\\\n\\\\nThe ease of formation of the positive and\\\\n    negative ions from the respective neutral\\\\n    atoms;\\\\n\\\\nThe arrangement of the positive and\\\\n    negative ions in the solid, that is, the\\\\n    lattice of the crystalline compound.\\\\n    The formation of a positive ion involves\\\\nionization, i.e., removal of electron(s) from\\\\nthe neutral atom and that of the negative ion\\\\ninvolves the addition of electron(s) to the\\\\nneutral atom.\\\\n\\\\nM(g) → M+(g) + e– ;\\\\nIonization enthalpy\\\\nX(g) + e– → X –^ (g) ;\\\\nElectron gain enthalpy\\\\nM+(g) + X –(g) → MX(s)\\\\nThe electron gain enthalpy, ∆∆∆∆∆ egH , is the\\\\nenthalpy change (Unit 3), when a gas phase atom\\\\nin its ground state gains an electron. The\\\\nelectron gain process may be exothermic or\\\\nendothermic. The ionization, on the other hand,\\\\nis always endothermic. Electron affinity, is the\\\\nnegative of the energy change accompanying\\\\nelectron gain.\\\\n\\\\nObviously ionic bonds will be formed\\\\nmore easily between elements with\\\\ncomparatively low ionization enthalpies\\\\nand elements with comparatively high\\\\nnegative value of electron gain enthalpy.\\\\nMost ionic compounds have cations\\\\nderived from metallic elements and anions\\\\nfrom non-metallic elements. The\\\\nammonium ion, NH 4 + (made up of two non-\\\\nmetallic elements) is an exception. It forms\\\\nthe cation of a number of ionic compounds.\\\\nIonic compounds in the crystalline state\\\\nconsist of orderly three-dimensional\\\\narrangements of cations and anions held\\\\ntogether by coulombic interaction energies.\\\\nThese compounds crystallise in different\\\\ncrystal structures determined by the size\\\\nof the ions, their packing arrangements and\\\\nother factors. The crystal structure of\\\\nsodium chloride, NaCl (rock salt), for\\\\nexample is shown below.\\\\nIn ionic solids, the sum of the electron\\\\ngain enthalpy and the ionization enthalpy\\\\nmay be positive but still the crystal\\\\nstructure gets stabilized due to the energy\\\\nreleased in the formation of the crystal\\\\nlattice. For example: the ionization\\\\nenthalpy for Na+(g) formation from Na(g)\\\\nis 495.8 kJ mol–1 ; while the electron gain\\\\nenthalpy for the change Cl(g) + e–→\\\\nCl–^ (g) is, – 348.7 kJ mol–1 only. The sum\\\\nof the two, 147.1 kJ mol-1 is more than\\\\ncompensated for by the enthalpy of lattice\\\\nformation of NaCl(s) (–788 kJ mol–1).\\\\nTherefore, the energy released in the\\\\nRock salt structure\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^107\\\\n\\\\nprocesses is more than the energy absorbed.\\\\nThus a qualitative measure of the\\\\nstability of an ionic compound is\\\\nprovided by its enthalpy of lattice\\\\nformation and not simply by achieving\\\\noctet of electrons around the ionic species\\\\nin gaseous state.\\\\nSince lattice enthalpy plays a key role\\\\nin the formation of ionic compounds, it is\\\\nimportant that we learn more about it.\\\\n4.2.1 Lattice Enthalpy\\\\nThe Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid is\\\\ndefined as the energy required to\\\\ncompletely separate one mole of a solid\\\\nionic compound into gaseous constituent\\\\nions. For example, the lattice enthalpy of NaCl\\\\nis 788 kJ mol–1. This means that 788 kJ of\\\\nenergy is required to separate one mole of\\\\nsolid NaCl into one mole of Na+ (g) and one\\\\nmole of Cl– (g) to an infinite distance.\\\\nThis process involves both the attractive\\\\nforces between ions of opposite charges and\\\\nthe repulsive forces between ions of like\\\\ncharge. The solid crystal being three-\\\\ndimensional; it is not possible to calculate\\\\nlattice enthalpy directly from the interaction\\\\nof forces of attraction and repulsion only.\\\\nFactors associated with the crystal geometry\\\\nhave to be included.\\\\n\\\\n4.3 Bond Parameters\\\\n\\\\n4.3.1 Bond Length\\\\nBond length is defined as the equilibrium\\\\ndistance between the nuclei of two bonded\\\\natoms in a molecule. Bond lengths are\\\\nmeasured by spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction\\\\nand electron-diffraction techniques about\\\\nwhich you will learn in higher classes. Each\\\\natom of the bonded pair contributes to the\\\\nbond length (Fig. 4.1). In the case of a covalent\\\\nbond, the contribution from each atom is\\\\ncalled the covalent radius of that atom.\\\\nThe covalent radius is measured\\\\napproximately as the radius of an atom’s\\\\ncore which is in contact with the core of\\\\nan adjacent atom in a bonded situation.\\\\nThe covalent radius is half of the distance\\\\nbetween two similar atoms joined by a\\\\n\\\\nFig. 4.1 The bond length in a covalent\\\\nmolecule AB.\\\\nR = rA + rB (R is the bond length and rA and rB\\\\nare the covalent radii of atoms A and B\\\\nrespectively)\\\\ncovalent bond in the same molecule.

Further, the van\\\\nder Waals radius is half of the distance\\\\nbetween two similar atoms in separate\\\\nmolecules in a solid.

Bond\\\\nangle is expressed in degree which can be\\\\nexperimentally determined by spectroscopic\\\\nmethods. It gives some idea regarding the\\\\ndistribution of orbitals around the central\\\\natom in a molecule/complex ion and hence it\\\\nhelps us in determining its shape.

It also gives\\\\nno idea about the shapes of polyatomic\\\\nmolecules.\\\\nSimilarly the VSEPR theory gives the\\\\ngeometry of simple molecules but\\\\ntheoretically, it does not explain them and also\\\\nit has limited applications. To overcome these\\\\nlimitations the two important theories based\\\\non quantum mechanical principles are\\\\nintroduced. These are valence bond (VB) theory\\\\nand molecular orbital (MO) theory.\\\\nValence bond theory was introduced by\\\\nHeitler and London (1927) and developed\\\\nfurther by Pauling and others. A discussion\\\\nof the valence bond theory is based on the\\\\nknowledge of atomic orbitals, electronic\\\\nconfigurations of elements (Units 2), the\\\\noverlap criteria of atomic orbitals, the\\\\nhybridization of atomic orbitals and the\\\\nprinciples of variation and superposition. A\\\\nrigorous treatment of the VB theory in terms\\\\nof these aspects is beyond the scope of this\\\\nbook. Therefore, for the sake of convenience,\\\\nvalence bond theory has been discussed in\\\\nterms of qualitative and non-mathematical\\\\ntreatment only. To start with, let us consider\\\\nthe formation of hydrogen molecule which is\\\\nthe simplest of all molecules.\\\\nConsider two hydrogen atoms A and B\\\\napproaching each other having nuclei NA and\\\\nNB and electrons present in them are\\\\nrepresented by eA and eB. When the two atoms\\\\nare at large distance from each other, there is\\\\nno interaction between them. As these two\\\\natoms approach each other, new attractive and\\\\nrepulsive forces begin to operate.\\\\nAttractive forces arise between:\\\\n(i) nucleus of one atom and its own electron\\\\nthat is NA – eA and NB– eB.\\\\n\\\\n118 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n(ii) nucleus of one atom and electron of other\\\\natom i.e., NA– eB, NB– eA.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly repulsive forces arise between\\\\n(i) electrons of two atoms like eA – eB,\\\\n(ii) nuclei of two atoms NA – NB.\\\\n\\\\nAttractive forces tend to bring the two\\\\natoms close to each other whereas repulsive\\\\nforces tend to push them apart (Fig. 4.7).\\\\n\\\\nExperimentally it has been found that the\\\\nmagnitude of new attractive force is more than\\\\nthe new repulsive forces. As a result, two\\\\natoms approach each other and potential\\\\nenergy decreases. Ultimately a stage is\\\\nreached where the net force of attraction\\\\nbalances the force of repulsion and system\\\\nacquires minimum energy. At this stage two\\\\n\\\\nFig. 4.7 Forces of attraction and repulsion during\\\\nthe formation of H 2 molecule.\\\\n\\\\nhydrogen atoms are said to be bonded together\\\\nto form a stable molecule having the bond\\\\nlength of 74 pm.\\\\nSince the energy gets released when the\\\\nbond is formed between two hydrogen atoms,\\\\nthe hydrogen molecule is more stable than that\\\\nof isolated hydrogen atoms. The energy so\\\\nreleased is called as bond enthalpy, which is\\\\ncorresponding to minimum in the curve\\\\ndepicted in Fig. 4.8. Conversely, 435.8 kJ of\\\\nenergy is required to dissociate one mole of\\\\nH 2 molecule.\\\\nH 2 (g) + 435.8 kJ mol–1 → H(g) + H(g)\\\\n4.5.1 Orbital Overlap Concept\\\\nIn the formation of hydrogen molecule, there\\\\nis a minimum energy state when two hydrogen\\\\natoms are so near that their atomic orbitals\\\\nundergo partial interpenetration. This partial\\\\nmerging of atomic orbitals is called overlapping\\\\nof atomic orbitals which results in the pairing\\\\nof electrons. The extent of overlap decides the\\\\nstrength of a covalent bond. In general, greater\\\\nthe overlap the stronger is the bond formed\\\\nbetween two atoms. Therefore, according to\\\\norbital overlap concept, the formation of a\\\\ncovalent bond between two atoms results by\\\\npairing of electrons present in the valence shell\\\\nhaving opposite spins.\\\\nFig. 4.8The potential energy curve for the\\\\nformation of H 2 molecule as a function of\\\\ninternuclear distance of the H atoms. The\\\\nminimum in the curve corresponds to the\\\\nmost stable state of H 2.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^119\\\\n\\\\n4.5.2 Directional Properties of Bonds\\\\nAs we have already seen, the covalent bond is\\\\nformed by overlapping of atomic orbitals. The\\\\nmolecule of hydrogen is formed due to the\\\\noverlap of 1 s -orbitals of two H atoms.\\\\nIn case of polyatomic molecules like CH 4 ,\\\\nNH 3 and H 2 O, the geometry of the molecules is\\\\nalso important in addition to the bond\\\\nformation. For example why is it so that CH 4\\\\nmolecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH bond\\\\nangles are 109.5°? Why is the shape of NH 3\\\\nmolecule pyramidal?\\\\nThe valence bond theory explains the\\\\nshape, the formation and directional properties\\\\nof bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH 4 , NH 3\\\\nand H 2 O, etc. in terms of overlap and\\\\nhybridisation of atomic orbitals.\\\\n4.5.3 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals\\\\nWhen orbitals of two atoms come close to form\\\\nbond, their overlap may be positive, negative\\\\nor zero depending upon the sign (phase) and\\\\ndirection of orientation of amplitude of orbital\\\\nwave function in space (Fig. 4.9). Positive and\\\\nnegative sign on boundary surface diagrams\\\\nin the Fig. 4.9 show the sign (phase) of orbital\\\\nwave function and are not related to charge.\\\\nOrbitals forming bond should have same sign\\\\n(phase) and orientation in space. This is called\\\\npositive overlap. Various overlaps of s and p\\\\norbitals are depicted in Fig. 4.9.\\\\nThe criterion of overlap, as the main factor\\\\nfor the formation of covalent bonds applies\\\\nuniformly to the homonuclear/heteronuclear\\\\ndiatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules.\\\\nWe know that the shapes of CH 4 , NH 3 , and H 2 O\\\\nmolecules are tetrahedral, pyramidal and bent\\\\nrespectively. It would be therefore interesting\\\\nto use VB theory to find out if these geometrical\\\\nshapes can be explained in terms of the orbital\\\\noverlaps.\\\\nLet us first consider the CH 4 (methane)\\\\nmolecule. The electronic configuration of\\\\ncarbon in its ground state is [He]2 s^2 2 p^2 which\\\\nin the excited state becomes [He] 2 s^1 2 p x^1 2 p y^1\\\\n2 p z^1. The energy required for this excitation is\\\\ncompensated by the release of energy due to\\\\noverlap between the orbitals of carbon and the\\\\nFig.4.9 Positive, negative and zero overlaps of\\\\ns and p atomic orbitals\\\\nhydrogen.The four atomic orbitals of carbon,\\\\neach with an unpaired electron can overlap\\\\nwith the 1 s orbitals of the four H atoms which\\\\nare also singly occupied. This will result in the\\\\nformation of four C-H bonds. It will, however,\\\\nbe observed that while the three p orbitals of\\\\ncarbon are at 90° to one another, the HCH\\\\nangle for these will also be 90°. That is three\\\\nC-H bonds will be oriented at 90° to one\\\\nanother. The 2 s orbital of carbon and the 1 s\\\\norbital of H are spherically symmetrical and\\\\nthey can overlap in any direction. Therefore\\\\nthe direction of the fourth C-H bond cannot\\\\nbe ascertained. This description does not fit\\\\nin with the tetrahedral HCH angles of 109.5°.\\\\nClearly, it follows that simple atomic orbital\\\\noverlap does not account for the directional\\\\ncharacteristics of bonds in CH 4. Using similar\\\\nprocedure and arguments, it can be seen that in the\\\\n\\\\n120 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\ncase of NH 3 and H 2 O molecules, the HNH and\\\\nHOH angles should be 90 °. This is in\\\\ndisagreement with the actual bond angles of\\\\n107 ° and 104.5° in the NH 3 and H 2 O\\\\nmolecules respectively.\\\\n\\\\n4.5.4 Types of Overlapping and Nature of\\\\nCovalent Bonds\\\\n\\\\nThe covalent bond may be classified into two\\\\ntypes depending upon the types of\\\\noverlapping:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Sigma(σ) bond, and (ii) pi(π) bond\\\\n\\\\n(i) Sigma(σσσσσ) bond : This type of covalent bond\\\\nis formed by the end to end (head-on)\\\\noverlap of bonding orbitals along the\\\\ninternuclear axis. This is called as head\\\\non overlap or axial overlap. This can be\\\\nformed by any one of the following types\\\\nof combinations of atomic orbitals.\\\\n\\\\ns-s overlapping : In this case, there is\\\\n    overlap of two half filled s -orbitals along\\\\n    the internuclear axis as shown below :\\\\n\\\\ns-p overlapping: This type of overlap\\\\n    occurs between half filled s -orbitals of one\\\\n    atom and half filled p -orbitals of another\\\\n    atom.\\\\n\\\\np–p overlapping : This type of overlap\\\\n    takes place between half filled p -orbitals\\\\n    of the two approaching atoms.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) pi(π π π π π ) bond : In the formation of π bond\\\\nthe atomic orbitals overlap in such a way\\\\nthat their axes remain parallel to each other\\\\nand perpendicular to the internuclear axis.\\\\nThe orbitals formed due to sidewise\\\\noverlapping consists of two saucer type\\\\n\\\\ncharged clouds above and below the plane\\\\nof the participating atoms.\\\\n4.5.5 Strength of Sigma and pi Bonds\\\\nBasically the strength of a bond depends upon\\\\nthe extent of overlapping. In case of sigma bond,\\\\nthe overlapping of orbitals takes place to a\\\\nlarger extent. Hence, it is stronger as compared\\\\nto the pi bond where the extent of overlapping\\\\noccurs to a smaller extent. Further, it is\\\\nimportant to note that in the formation of\\\\nmultiple bonds between two atoms of a\\\\nmolecule, pi bond(s) is formed in addition to a\\\\nsigma bond.\\\\n\\\\n4.6 Hybridisation\\\\n\\\\nIn order to explain the characteristic\\\\ngeometrical shapes of polyatomic molecules\\\\nlike CH 4 , NH 3 and H 2 O etc., Pauling introduced\\\\nthe concept of hybridisation. According to him\\\\nthe atomic orbitals combine to form new set of\\\\nequivalent orbitals known as hybrid orbitals.\\\\nUnlike pure orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are\\\\nused in bond formation. The phenomenon is\\\\nknown as hybridisation which can be defined\\\\nas the process of intermixing of the orbitals of\\\\nslightly different energies so as to redistribute\\\\ntheir energies, resulting in the formation of new\\\\nset of orbitals of equivalent energies and shape.\\\\nFor example when one 2 s and three 2 p -orbitals\\\\nof carbon hybridise, there is the formation of\\\\nfour new sp^3 hybrid orbitals.\\\\nSalient features of hybridisation: The main\\\\nfeatures of hybridisation are as under :\\\\n1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to\\\\n    the number of the atomic orbitals that get\\\\n    hybridised.\\\\n2. The hybridised orbitals are always\\\\n    equivalent in energy and shape.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^121\\\\n\\\\nThe hybrid orbitals are more effective in\\\\n    forming stable bonds than the pure atomic\\\\n    orbitals.\\\\n\\\\nThese hybrid orbitals are directed in space\\\\n    in some preferred direction to have\\\\n    minimum repulsion between electron\\\\n    pairs and thus a stable arrangement.\\\\n    Therefore, the type of hybridisation\\\\n    indicates the geometry of the molecules.\\\\nImportant conditions for hybridisation\\\\n(i) The orbitals present in the valence shell\\\\n    of the atom are hybridised.\\\\n(ii) The orbitals undergoing hybridisation\\\\n    should have almost equal energy.\\\\n(iii)Promotion of electron is not essential\\\\n    condition prior to hybridisation.\\\\n(iv)It is not necessary that only half filled\\\\n    orbitals participate in hybridisation. In\\\\n    some cases, even filled orbitals of valence\\\\n    shell take part in hybridisation.\\\\n4.6.1 Types of Hybridisation\\\\nThere are various types of hybridisation\\\\ninvolving s , p and d orbitals. The different\\\\ntypes of hybridisation are as under:\\\\n(I) sp hybridisation: This type of\\\\nhybridisation involves the mixing of one s and\\\\none p orbital resulting in the formation of two\\\\nequivalent sp hybrid orbitals. The suitable\\\\norbitals for sp hybridisation are s and p z, if\\\\nthe hybrid orbitals are to lie along the z-axis.\\\\nEach sp hybrid orbitals has 50% s -character\\\\nand 50% p -character. Such a molecule in\\\\nwhich the central atom is sp -hybridised and\\\\nlinked directly to two other central atoms\\\\npossesses linear geometry. This type of\\\\nhybridisation is also known as diagonal\\\\nhybridisation.\\\\n    The two sp hybrids point in the opposite\\\\ndirection along the z-axis with projecting\\\\npositive lobes and very small negative lobes,\\\\nwhich provides more effective overlapping\\\\nresulting in the formation of stronger bonds.\\\\nExample of molecule having sp\\\\nhybridisation\\\\nBeCl 2 : The ground state electronic\\\\nconfiguration of Be is 1 s^22 s^2. In the exited state\\\\none of the 2 s -electrons is promoted to\\\\n\\\\nvacant 2 p orbital to account for its bivalency.\\\\nOne 2 s and one 2 p -orbital gets hybridised to\\\\nform two sp hybridised orbitals. These two\\\\nsp hybrid orbitals are oriented in opposite\\\\ndirection forming an angle of 180°. Each of\\\\nthe sp hybridised orbital overlaps with the\\\\n2 p -orbital of chlorine axially and form two Be-\\\\nCl sigma bonds. This is shown in Fig. 4.10.\\\\n(II) sp^2 hybridisation : In this hybridisation\\\\nthere is involvement of one s and two\\\\np -orbitals in order to form three equivalent sp^2\\\\nhybridised orbitals. For example, in BCl 3\\\\nmolecule, the ground state electronic\\\\nconfiguration of central boron atom is\\\\n1 s^22 s^22 p^1. In the excited state, one of the 2 s\\\\nelectrons is promoted to vacant 2 p orbital as\\\\nFig.4.10 (a) Formation of sp hybrids from s and\\\\np orbitals; (b) Formation of the linear\\\\nBeCl 2 molecule\\\\nBe\\\\nFig.4.11 Formation of sp^2 hybrids and the BCl 3\\\\nmolecule\\\\n\\\\n122 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\na result boron has three unpaired electrons.\\\\nThese three orbitals (one 2 s and two 2 p )\\\\nhybridise to form three sp^2 hybrid orbitals. The\\\\nthree hybrid orbitals so formed are oriented in\\\\na trigonal planar arrangement and overlap with\\\\n2 p orbitals of chlorine to form three B-Cl\\\\nbonds. Therefore, in BCl 3 (Fig. 4.11), the\\\\ngeometry is trigonal planar with ClBCl bond\\\\nangle of 120°.\\\\n\\\\nFig.4.12 Formation of sp^3 hybrids by the\\\\ncombination of s , px , py and pz atomic\\\\norbitals of carbon and the formation of\\\\nCH 4 molecule\\\\n\\\\nσ\\\\nσ\\\\nσ\\\\nσ\\\\nThe structure of NH 3 and H 2 O molecules\\\\ncan also be explained with the help of sp^3\\\\nhybridisation. In NH 3 , the valence shell (outer)\\\\nelectronic configuration of nitrogen in the\\\\n\\\\nground state is 2 2 2 2 S^2 p^1 x p^1 y p^1 z having three\\\\nunpaired electrons in the sp^3 hybrid orbitals\\\\nand a lone pair of electrons is present in the\\\\nfourth one. These three hybrid orbitals overlap\\\\nwith 1 s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form\\\\nthree N–H sigma bonds. We know that the force\\\\nof repulsion between a lone pair and a bond\\\\npair is more than the force of repulsion\\\\nbetween two bond pairs of electrons. The\\\\nmolecule thus gets distorted and the bond\\\\nangle is reduced to 107° from 109.5°. The\\\\ngeometry of such a molecule will be pyramidal\\\\nas shown in Fig. 4.13.\\\\nFig.4.13 Formation of NH 3 molecule\\\\nIn case of H 2 O molecule, the four oxygen\\\\norbitals (one 2 s and three 2 p ) undergo sp^3\\\\nhybridisation forming four sp^3 hybrid orbitals\\\\nout of which two contain one electron each and\\\\nthe other two contain a pair of electrons. These\\\\nfour sp^3 hybrid orbitals acquire a tetrahedral\\\\ngeometry, with two corners occupied by\\\\nhydrogen atoms while the other two by the lone\\\\npairs. The bond angle in this case is reduced\\\\nto 104.5° from 109.5° (Fig. 4.14) and the\\\\nmolecule thus acquires a V-shape or\\\\nangular geometry.\\\\nFig.4.14 Formation of H 2 O molecule\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^123\\\\n\\\\n4.6.2 Other Examples of sp^3 , sp^2 and sp\\\\nHybridisation\\\\nsp^3 Hybridisation in C 2 H 6 molecule: In\\\\nethane molecule both the carbon atoms\\\\nassume sp^3 hybrid state. One of the four sp^3\\\\nhybrid orbitals of carbon atom overlaps axially\\\\nwith similar orbitals of other atom to form\\\\nsp^3 - sp^3 sigma bond while the other three\\\\nhybrid orbitals of each carbon atom are used\\\\nin forming sp^3 – s sigma bonds with hydrogen\\\\natoms as discussed in section 4.6.1(iii).\\\\nTherefore in ethane C–C bond length is 154\\\\npm and each C–H bond length is 109', 'lone pair and (ii)\\\\nmolecules in which the central atom has\\\\none or more lone pairs.\\\\nTable 4.6 (page114) shows the\\\\narrangement of electron pairs about a central\\\\natom A (without any lone pairs) and\\\\ngeometries of some molecules/ions of the type\\\\nAB. Table 4.7 (page 115) shows shapes of some\\\\nsimple molecules and ions in which the central\\\\natom has one or more lone pairs. Table 4.8\\\\n(page 116) explains the reasons for the\\\\ndistortions in the geometry of the molecule.\\\\nAs depicted in Table 4.6, in the\\\\ncompounds of AB 2 , AB 3 , AB 4 , AB 5 and AB 6 ,\\\\nthe arrangement of electron pairs and the B\\\\natoms around the central atom A are : linear,\\\\ntrigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal-\\\\nbipyramidal and octahedral, respectively.\\\\nSuch arrangement can be seen in the\\\\nmolecules like BF 3 (AB 3 ), CH 4 (AB 4 ) and PCl 5\\\\n(AB 5 ) as depicted below by their ball and\\\\nstick models.\\\\nThe VSEPR Theory is able to predict\\\\ngeometry of a large number of molecules,\\\\nespecially the compounds of p -block elements\\\\naccurately. It is also quite successful in\\\\ndetermining the geometry quite-accurately\\\\neven when the energy difference between\\\\npossible structures is very small. The\\\\ntheoretical basis of the VSEPR theory\\\\nregarding the effects of electron pair repulsions\\\\non molecular shapes is not clear and\\\\ncontinues to be a subject of doubt and\\\\ndiscussion.\\\\nFig. 4.6 The shapes of molecules in which\\\\ncentral atom has no lone pair\\\\n\\\\n114 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nTable 4.6 Geometry of Molecules in which the Central Atom has No Lone Pair of Electrons\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^115\\\\n\\\\nTable 4.7 Shape (geometry) of Some Simple Molecules/Ions with Central Ions having One or\\\\nMore Lone Pairs of Electrons(E).\\\\n\\\\n116 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^117\\\\n\\\\n4.5 Valence Bond Theory\\\\n\\\\nAs we know that Lewis approach helps in\\\\nwriting the structure of molecules but it fails\\\\nto explain the formation of chemical bond. It\\\\nalso does not give any reason for the difference\\\\nin bond dissociation enthalpies and bond\\\\nlengths in molecules like H 2 (435.8 kJ mol-1,\\\\n74 pm) and F 2 (155 kJ mol-1, 144 pm),\\\\nalthough in both the cases a single covalent\\\\nbond is formed by the sharing of an electron\\\\npair between the respective atoms. It also gives\\\\nno idea about the shapes of polyatomic\\\\nmolecules.\\\\nSimilarly the VSEPR theory gives the\\\\ngeometry of simple molecules but\\\\ntheoretically, it does not explain them and also\\\\nit has limited applications. To overcome these\\\\nlimitations the two important theories based\\\\non quantum mechanical principles are\\\\nintroduced. These are valence bond (VB) theory\\\\nand molecular orbital (MO) theory.\\\\nValence bond theory was introduced by\\\\nHeitler and London (1927) and developed\\\\nfurther by Pauling and others. A discussion\\\\nof the valence bond theory is based on the\\\\nknowledge of atomic orbitals, electronic\\\\nconfigurations of elements (Units 2), the\\\\noverlap criteria of atomic orbitals, the\\\\nhybridization of atomic orbitals and the\\\\nprinciples of variation and superposition. A\\\\nrigorous treatment of the VB theory in terms\\\\nof these aspects is beyond the scope of this\\\\nbook. Therefore, for the sake of convenience,\\\\nvalence bond theory has been discussed in\\\\nterms of qualitative and non-mathematical\\\\ntreatment only. To start with, let us consider\\\\nthe formation of hydrogen molecule which is\\\\nthe simplest of all molecules.\\\\nConsider two hydrogen atoms A and B\\\\napproaching each other having nuclei NA and\\\\nNB and electrons present in them are\\\\nrepresented by eA and eB. When the two atoms\\\\nare at large distance from each other, there is\\\\nno interaction between them. As these two\\\\natoms approach each other, new attractive and\\\\nrepulsive forces begin to operate.\\\\nAttractive forces arise between:\\\\n(i) nucleus of one atom and its own electron\\\\nthat is NA – eA and NB– eB.\\\\n\\\\n118 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n(ii) nucleus of one atom and electron of other\\\\natom i.e., NA– eB, NB– eA.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly repulsive forces arise between\\\\n(i) electrons of two atoms like eA – eB,\\\\n(ii) nuclei of two atoms NA – NB.\\\\n\\\\nAttractive forces tend to bring the two\\\\natoms close to each other whereas repulsive\\\\nforces tend to push them apart (Fig. 4.7).\\\\n\\\\nExperimentally it has been found that the\\\\nmagnitude of new attractive force is more than\\\\nthe new repulsive forces. As a result, two\\\\natoms approach each other and potential\\\\nenergy decreases. Ultimately a stage is\\\\nreached where the net force of attraction\\\\nbalances the force of repulsion and system\\\\nacquires minimum energy. At this stage two\\\\n\\\\nFig. 4.7 Forces of attraction and repulsion during\\\\nthe formation of H 2 molecule.\\\\n\\\\nhydrogen atoms are said to be bonded together\\\\nto form a stable molecule having the bond\\\\nlength of 74 pm.\\\\nSince the energy gets released when the\\\\nbond is formed between two hydrogen atoms,\\\\nthe hydrogen molecule is more stable than that\\\\nof isolated hydrogen atoms. The energy so\\\\nreleased is called as bond enthalpy, which is\\\\ncorresponding to minimum in the curve\\\\ndepicted in Fig. 4.8. Conversely, 435.8 kJ of\\\\nenergy is required to dissociate one mole of\\\\nH 2 molecule.\\\\nH 2 (g) + 435.8 kJ mol–1 → H(g) + H(g)\\\\n4.5.1 Orbital Overlap Concept\\\\nIn the formation of hydrogen molecule, there\\\\nis a minimum energy state when two hydrogen\\\\natoms are so near that their atomic orbitals\\\\nundergo partial interpenetration. This partial\\\\nmerging of atomic orbitals is called overlapping\\\\nof atomic orbitals which results in the pairing\\\\nof electrons. The extent of overlap decides the\\\\nstrength of a covalent bond. In general, greater\\\\nthe overlap the stronger is the bond formed\\\\nbetween two atoms. Therefore, according to\\\\norbital overlap concept, the formation of a\\\\ncovalent bond between two atoms results by\\\\npairing of electrons present in the valence shell\\\\nhaving opposite spins.\\\\nFig. 4.8The potential energy curve for the\\\\nformation of H 2 molecule as a function of\\\\ninternuclear distance of the H atoms. The\\\\nminimum in the curve corresponds to the\\\\nmost stable state of H 2.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^119\\\\n\\\\n4.5.2 Directional Properties of Bonds\\\\nAs we have already seen, the covalent bond is\\\\nformed by overlapping of atomic orbitals. The\\\\nmolecule of hydrogen is formed due to the\\\\noverlap of 1 s -orbitals of two H atoms.\\\\nIn case of polyatomic molecules like CH 4 ,\\\\nNH 3 and H 2 O, the geometry of the molecules is\\\\nalso important in addition to the bond\\\\nformation. For example why is it so that CH 4\\\\nmolecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH bond\\\\nangles are 109.5°? Why is the shape of NH 3\\\\nmolecule pyramidal?\\\\nThe valence bond theory explains the\\\\nshape, the formation and directional properties\\\\nof bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH 4 , NH 3\\\\nand H 2 O, etc. in terms of overlap and\\\\nhybridisation of atomic orbitals.\\\\n4.5.3 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals\\\\nWhen orbitals of two atoms come close to form\\\\nbond, their overlap may be positive, negative\\\\nor zero depending upon the sign (phase) and\\\\ndirection of orientation of amplitude of orbital\\\\nwave function in space (Fig. 4.9). Positive and\\\\nnegative sign on boundary surface diagrams\\\\nin the Fig. 4.9 show the sign (phase) of orbital\\\\nwave function and are not related to charge.\\\\nOrbitals forming bond should have same sign\\\\n(phase) and orientation in space. This is called\\\\npositive overlap. Various overlaps of s and p\\\\norbitals are depicted in Fig. 4.9.\\\\nThe criterion of overlap, as the main factor\\\\nfor the formation of covalent bonds applies\\\\nuniformly to the homonuclear/heteronuclear\\\\ndiatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules.\\\\nWe know that the shapes of CH 4 , NH 3 , and H 2 O\\\\nmolecules are tetrahedral, pyramidal and bent\\\\nrespectively. It would be therefore interesting\\\\nto use VB theory to find out if these geometrical\\\\nshapes can be explained in terms of the orbital\\\\noverlaps.\\\\nLet us first consider the CH 4 (methane)\\\\nmolecule. The electronic configuration of\\\\ncarbon in its ground state is [He]2 s^2 2 p^2 which\\\\nin the excited state becomes [He] 2 s^1 2 p x^1 2 p y^1\\\\n2 p z^1. The energy required for this excitation is\\\\ncompensated by the release of energy due to\\\\noverlap between the orbitals of carbon and the\\\\nFig.4.9 Positive, negative and zero overlaps of\\\\ns and p atomic orbitals\\\\nhydrogen.The four atomic orbitals of carbon,\\\\neach with an unpaired electron can overlap\\\\nwith the 1 s orbitals of the four H atoms which\\\\nare also singly occupied. This will result in the\\\\nformation of four C-H bonds. It will, however,\\\\nbe observed that while the three p orbitals of\\\\ncarbon are at 90° to one another, the HCH\\\\nangle for these will also be 90°. That is three\\\\nC-H bonds will be oriented at 90° to one\\\\nanother. The 2 s orbital of carbon and the 1 s\\\\norbital of H are spherically symmetrical and\\\\nthey can overlap in any direction. Therefore\\\\nthe direction of the fourth C-H bond cannot\\\\nbe ascertained. This description does not fit\\\\nin with the tetrahedral HCH angles of 109.5°.\\\\nClearly, it follows that simple atomic orbital\\\\noverlap does not account for the directional\\\\ncharacteristics of bonds in CH 4. Using similar\\\\nprocedure and arguments, it can be seen that in the\\\\n\\\\n120 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\ncase of NH 3 and H 2 O molecules, the HNH and\\\\nHOH angles should be 90 °. This is in\\\\ndisagreement with the actual bond angles of\\\\n107 ° and 104.5° in the NH 3 and H 2 O\\\\nmolecules respectively.\\\\n\\\\n4.5.4 Types of Overlapping and Nature of\\\\nCovalent Bonds\\\\n\\\\nThe covalent bond may be classified into two\\\\ntypes depending upon the types of\\\\noverlapping:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Sigma(σ) bond, and (ii) pi(π) bond\\\\n\\\\n(i) Sigma(σσσσσ) bond : This type of covalent bond\\\\nis formed by the end to end (head-on)\\\\noverlap of bonding orbitals along the\\\\ninternuclear axis. This is called as head\\\\non overlap or axial overlap. This can be\\\\nformed by any one of the following types\\\\nof combinations of atomic orbitals.\\\\n\\\\ns-s overlapping : In this case, there is\\\\n    overlap of two half filled s -orbitals along\\\\n    the internuclear axis as shown below :\\\\n\\\\ns-p overlapping: This type of overlap\\\\n    occurs between half filled s -orbitals of one\\\\n    atom and half filled p -orbitals of another\\\\n    atom.\\\\n\\\\np–p overlapping : This type of overlap\\\\n    takes place between half filled p -orbitals\\\\n    of the two approaching atoms.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) pi(π π π π π ) bond : In the formation of π bond\\\\nthe atomic orbitals overlap in such a way\\\\nthat their axes remain parallel to each other\\\\nand perpendicular to the internuclear axis.\\\\nThe orbitals formed due to sidewise\\\\noverlapping consists of two saucer type\\\\n\\\\ncharged clouds above and below the plane\\\\nof the participating atoms.\\\\n4.5.5 Strength of Sigma and pi Bonds\\\\nBasically the strength of a bond depends upon\\\\nthe extent of overlapping. In case of sigma bond,\\\\nthe overlapping of orbitals takes place to a\\\\nlarger extent. Hence, it is stronger as compared\\\\nto the pi bond where the extent of overlapping\\\\noccurs to a smaller extent. Further, it is\\\\nimportant to note that in the formation of\\\\nmultiple bonds between two atoms of a\\\\nmolecule, pi bond(s) is formed in addition to a\\\\nsigma bond.\\\\n\\\\n4.6 Hybridisation\\\\n\\\\nIn order to explain the characteristic\\\\ngeometrical shapes of polyatomic molecules\\\\nlike CH 4 , NH 3 and H 2 O etc., Pauling introduced\\\\nthe concept of hybridisation. According to him\\\\nthe atomic orbitals combine to form new set of\\\\nequivalent orbitals known as hybrid orbitals.\\\\nUnlike pure orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are\\\\nused in bond formation. The phenomenon is\\\\nknown as hybridisation which can be defined\\\\nas the process of intermixing of the orbitals of\\\\nslightly different energies so as to redistribute\\\\ntheir energies, resulting in the formation of new\\\\nset of orbitals of equivalent energies and shape.\\\\nFor example when one 2 s and three 2 p -orbitals\\\\nof carbon hybridise, there is the formation of\\\\nfour new sp^3 hybrid orbitals.\\\\nSalient features of hybridisation: The main\\\\nfeatures of hybridisation are as under :\\\\n1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to\\\\n    the number of the atomic orbitals that get\\\\n    hybridised.\\\\n2. The hybridised orbitals are always\\\\n    equivalent in energy and shape.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^121\\\\n\\\\nThe hybrid orbitals are more effective in\\\\n    forming stable bonds than the pure atomic\\\\n    orbitals.\\\\n\\\\nThese hybrid orbitals are directed in space\\\\n    in some preferred direction to have\\\\n    minimum repulsion between electron\\\\n    pairs and thus a stable arrangement.\\\\n    Therefore, the type of hybridisation\\\\n    indicates the geometry of the molecules.\\\\nImportant conditions for hybridisation\\\\n(i) The orbitals present in the valence shell\\\\n    of the atom are hybridised.\\\\n(ii) The orbitals undergoing hybridisation\\\\n    should have almost equal energy.\\\\n(iii)Promotion of electron is not essential\\\\n    condition prior to hybridisation.\\\\n(iv)It is not necessary that only half filled\\\\n    orbitals participate in hybridisation. In\\\\n    some cases, even filled orbitals of valence\\\\n    shell take part in hybridisation.\\\\n4.6.1 Types of Hybridisation\\\\nThere are various types of hybridisation\\\\ninvolving s , p and d orbitals. The different\\\\ntypes of hybridisation are as under:\\\\n(I) sp hybridisation: This type of\\\\nhybridisation involves the mixing of one s and\\\\none p orbital resulting in the formation of two\\\\nequivalent sp hybrid orbitals. The suitable\\\\norbitals for sp hybridisation are s and p z, if\\\\nthe hybrid orbitals are to lie along the z-axis.\\\\nEach sp hybrid orbitals has 50% s -character\\\\nand 50% p -character. Such a molecule in\\\\nwhich the central atom is sp -hybridised and\\\\nlinked directly to two other central atoms\\\\npossesses linear geometry. This type of\\\\nhybridisation is also known as diagonal\\\\nhybridisation.\\\\n    The two sp hybrids point in the opposite\\\\ndirection along the z-axis with projecting\\\\npositive lobes and very small negative lobes,\\\\nwhich provides more effective overlapping\\\\nresulting in the formation of stronger bonds.\\\\nExample of molecule having sp\\\\nhybridisation\\\\nBeCl 2 : The ground state electronic\\\\nconfiguration of Be is 1 s^22 s^2. In the exited state\\\\none of the 2 s -electrons is promoted to\\\\n\\\\nvacant 2 p orbital to account for its bivalency.\\\\nOne 2 s and one 2 p -orbital gets hybridised to\\\\nform two sp hybridised orbitals. These two\\\\nsp hybrid orbitals are oriented in opposite\\\\ndirection forming an angle of 180°. Each of\\\\nthe sp hybridised orbital overlaps with the\\\\n2 p -orbital of chlorine axially and form two Be-\\\\nCl sigma bonds. This is shown in Fig. 4.10.\\\\n(II) sp^2 hybridisation : In this hybridisation\\\\nthere is involvement of one s and two\\\\np -orbitals in order to form three equivalent sp^2\\\\nhybridised orbitals. For example, in BCl 3\\\\nmolecule, the ground state electronic\\\\nconfiguration of central boron atom is\\\\n1 s^22 s^22 p^1.

Hydrogen molecule (H 2 ): It is formed by\\\\nthe combination of two hydrogen atoms. Each\\\\nhydrogen atom has one electron in 1 s orbital.\\\\nTherefore, in all there are two electrons in\\\\nhydrogen molecule which are present in σ 1s\\\\nmolecular orbital. So electronic configuration\\\\nof hydrogen molecule is\\\\n    H 2 : (σ 1s )^2\\\\n    The bond order of H 2 molecule can be\\\\ncalculated as given below:\\\\n\\\\nBond order =\\\\nNb−Na\\\\n=\\\\n\\\\n2 0\\\\n\\\\nThis means that the two hydrogen atoms\\\\nare bonded together by a single covalent bond.\\\\nThe bond dissociation energy of hydrogen\\\\nmolecule has been found to be 438 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\n130 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nand bond length equal to 74 pm. Since no\\\\nunpaired electron is present in hydrogen\\\\nmolecule, therefore, it is diamagnetic.\\\\n\\\\n2. Helium molecule (He 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of helium atom is 1 s^2. Each helium\\\\natom contains 2 electrons, therefore, in He 2\\\\nmolecule there would be 4 electrons. These\\\\nelectrons will be accommodated in σ 1 s and σ*1 s\\\\nmolecular orbitals leading to electronic\\\\nconfiguration:\\\\n\\\\nHe 2 : (σ 1s )^2 (σ* 1s )^2\\\\nBond order of He 2 is ½(2 – 2) = 0\\\\nHe 2 molecule is therefore unstable and\\\\ndoes not exist.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, it can be shown that Be 2\\\\nmolecule (σ 1 s )^2 (σ1 s )^2 (σ 2 s )^2 (σ2 s )^2 also does\\\\nnot exist.\\\\n\\\\n3. Lithium molecule (Li 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of lithium is 1 s^2 , 2 s^1. There are\\\\nsix electrons in Li 2. The electronic configuration\\\\nof Li 2 molecule, therefore, is\\\\n\\\\nLi 2 : (σ 1 s )^2 (σ1 s )^2 (σ 2 s )^2\\\\nThe above configuration is also written as\\\\nKK(σ2s)^2 where KK represents the closed K shell\\\\nstructure (σ 1 s )^2 (σ1 s )^2.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the electronic configuration of Li 2\\\\nmolecule it is clear that there are four electrons\\\\npresent in bonding molecular orbitals and two\\\\nelectrons present in antibonding molecular\\\\norbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is ½ (4 – 2)\\\\n= 1. It means that Li 2 molecule is stable and\\\\nsince it has no unpaired electrons it should be\\\\ndiamagnetic. Indeed diamagnetic Li 2\\\\nmolecules are known to exist in the vapour\\\\nphase.\\\\n\\\\n4. Carbon molecule (C 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of carbon is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^2. There\\\\nare twelve electrons in C 2. The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of C 2 molecule, therefore, is\\\\n\\\\nThe bond order of C 2 is ½ (8 – 4) = 2 and C 2\\\\nshould be diamagnetic. Diamagnetic C 2\\\\n\\\\nmolecules have indeed been detected in vapour\\\\nphase. It is important to note that double bond\\\\nin C 2 consists of both pi bonds because of the\\\\npresence of four electrons in two pi molecular\\\\norbitals. In most of the other molecules a\\\\ndouble bond is made up of a sigma bond and\\\\na pi bond. In a similar fashion the bonding in\\\\nN 2 molecule can be discussed.\\\\n5. Oxygen molecule (O 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of oxygen atom is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4.\\\\nEach oxygen atom has 8 electrons, hence, in\\\\nO 2 molecule there are 16 electrons. The\\\\nelectronic configuration of O 2 molecule,\\\\ntherefore, is\\\\n\\\\nO : 2 KK ( 2 )^22\\\\n\\\\n2 2 2 2\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\nz\\\\ny\\\\n2\\\\nx\\\\n1\\\\ny\\\\n1\\\\nσ s σ s σ p\\\\np p p p\\\\n\\\\n( * ) ( )\\\\n\\\\n, * *\\\\n\\\\n2 2\\\\nπ^2 π π π\\\\n( x ≡ )( ≡ )\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ef\\\\uf8ef\\\\n\\\\nFrom the electronic configuration of O 2\\\\nmolecule it is clear that ten electrons are present\\\\nin bonding molecular orbitals and six electrons\\\\nare present in antibonding molecular orbitals.\\\\nIts bond order, therefore, is\\\\n[ b a] [ ]\\\\n\\\\n1 1\\\\n\\\\nBond order 10 6 2\\\\n2 2\\\\n\\\\n= N − N = − =\\\\n\\\\nSo in oxygen molecule, atoms are held\\\\nby a double bond. Moreover, it may be noted\\\\nthat it contains two unpaired electrons in\\\\nπ *2px and π *2py molecular orbitals,\\\\ntherefore, O 2 molecule should be\\\\nparamagnetic, a prediction that\\\\ncorresponds to experimental observation.\\\\nIn this way, the theory successfully explains\\\\nthe paramagnetic nature of oxygen.\\\\nSimilarly, the electronic configurations of\\\\nother homonuclear diatomic molecules of the\\\\nsecond row of the periodic table can be written.\\\\nIn Fig.4.21 are given the molecular orbital\\\\noccupancy and molecular properties for B 2\\\\nthrough Ne 2. The sequence of MOs and their\\\\nelectron population are shown. The bond\\\\nenergy, bond length, bond order, magnetic\\\\nproperties and valence electron configuration\\\\nappear below the orbital diagrams.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^131\\\\n\\\\n4.9 Hydrogen Bonding\\\\n\\\\nNitrogen, oxygen and fluorine are the higly\\\\nelectronegative elements. When they are\\\\nattached to a hydrogen atom to form covalent\\\\nbond, the electrons of the covalent bond are\\\\nshifted towards the more electronegative atom.\\\\nThis partially positively charged hydrogen\\\\natom forms a bond with the other more\\\\nelectronegative atom. This bond is known as\\\\nhydrogen bond and is weaker than the\\\\ncovalent bond. For example, in HF molecule,\\\\nthe hydrogen bond exists between hydrogen\\\\natom of one molecule and fluorine atom of\\\\nanother molecule as depicted below :\\\\n− − −H – Fδ+ δ−− − −H – Fδ+ δ−− − −H – Fδ+ δ −\\\\nHere, hydrogen bond acts as a bridge between\\\\ntwo atoms which holds one atom by covalent\\\\nbond and the other by hydrogen bond.\\\\nHydrogen bond is represented by a dotted line\\\\n(– – –) while a solid line represents the covalent\\\\nbond. Thus, hydrogen bond can be defined\\\\nas the attractive force which binds\\\\nhydrogen atom of one molecule with the\\\\nelectronegative atom (F, O or N) of another\\\\nmolecule.\\\\n4.9.1 Cause of Formation of Hydrogen\\\\nBond\\\\nWhen hydrogen is bonded to strongly\\\\nelectronegative element ‘X’, the electron pair\\\\nshared between the two atoms moves far away\\\\nfrom hydrogen atom. As a result the hydrogen\\\\natom becomes highly electropositive with\\\\nrespect to the other atom ‘X’. Since there is\\\\ndisplacement of electrons towards X, the\\\\nhydrogen acquires fractional positive charge\\\\n(δ +) while ‘X’ attain fractional negative charge\\\\nFig.4.21 MO occupancy and molecular properties for B 2 through Ne 2.\\\\n\\\\n132 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^133\\\\n\\\\nThe VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on\\\\nthe assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far\\\\napart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions\\\\nbetween lone pairs and lone pairs ; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and\\\\nbonding pairs. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp\\\\nThe valence bond (VB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the\\\\nenergetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent.\\\\nBasically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For\\\\nexample the formation of the H 2 molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of\\\\nthe 1 s orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential\\\\nenergy of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the\\\\nequilibrium inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any\\\\nattempt to bring the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent\\\\ndestabilization of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the\\\\nnuclei increases which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual\\\\nbond enthalpy and bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables\\\\nhave to be taken into account.\\\\nFor explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced\\\\nthe concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp , sp^2 , sp^3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals\\\\nof Be, B,C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules\\\\nlike BeCl 2 , BCl 3 , CH 4 , NH 3 and H 2 O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in\\\\nmolecules like C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 4.\\\\nThe molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination\\\\nand arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the\\\\nmolecule as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of\\\\natomic orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron\\\\ndensity between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals.\\\\nAntibonding molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei\\\\nand have more energy than the individual atomic orbitals.\\\\nThe electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the\\\\nmolecular orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the\\\\nPauli exclusion principle and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals.\\\\nMolecules are said to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is\\\\ngreater than that in antibonding molecular orbitals.\\\\nHydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly\\\\nelectronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two\\\\nor more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within\\\\nthe same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties\\\\nof many compounds.\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n4.1 Explain the formation of a chemical bond.\\\\n4.2 Write Lewis dot symbols for atoms of the following elements : Mg, Na, B, O, N, Br.\\\\n4.3 Write Lewis symbols for the following atoms and ions:\\\\nS and S2–; Al and Al3+; H and H–\\\\n4.4 Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules and ions :\\\\nH 2 S, SiCl 4 , BeF 2 , CO 32 −, HCOOH\\\\n\\\\n134 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n4.5 Define octet rule.

These\\\\nelectrons will be accommodated in σ 1 s and σ*1 s\\\\nmolecular orbitals leading to electronic\\\\nconfiguration:\\\\n\\\\nHe 2 : (σ 1s )^2 (σ* 1s )^2\\\\nBond order of He 2 is ½(2 – 2) = 0\\\\nHe 2 molecule is therefore unstable and\\\\ndoes not exist.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, it can be shown that Be 2\\\\nmolecule (σ 1 s )^2 (σ1 s )^2 (σ 2 s )^2 (σ2 s )^2 also does\\\\nnot exist.\\\\n\\\\n3. Lithium molecule (Li 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of lithium is 1 s^2 , 2 s^1. There are\\\\nsix electrons in Li 2. The electronic configuration\\\\nof Li 2 molecule, therefore, is\\\\n\\\\nLi 2 : (σ 1 s )^2 (σ1 s )^2 (σ 2 s )^2\\\\nThe above configuration is also written as\\\\nKK(σ2s)^2 where KK represents the closed K shell\\\\nstructure (σ 1 s )^2 (σ1 s )^2.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the electronic configuration of Li 2\\\\nmolecule it is clear that there are four electrons\\\\npresent in bonding molecular orbitals and two\\\\nelectrons present in antibonding molecular\\\\norbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is ½ (4 – 2)\\\\n= 1. It means that Li 2 molecule is stable and\\\\nsince it has no unpaired electrons it should be\\\\ndiamagnetic. Indeed diamagnetic Li 2\\\\nmolecules are known to exist in the vapour\\\\nphase.\\\\n\\\\n4. Carbon molecule (C 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of carbon is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^2. There\\\\nare twelve electrons in C 2. The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of C 2 molecule, therefore, is\\\\n\\\\nThe bond order of C 2 is ½ (8 – 4) = 2 and C 2\\\\nshould be diamagnetic. Diamagnetic C 2\\\\n\\\\nmolecules have indeed been detected in vapour\\\\nphase. It is important to note that double bond\\\\nin C 2 consists of both pi bonds because of the\\\\npresence of four electrons in two pi molecular\\\\norbitals. In most of the other molecules a\\\\ndouble bond is made up of a sigma bond and\\\\na pi bond. In a similar fashion the bonding in\\\\nN 2 molecule can be discussed.\\\\n5. Oxygen molecule (O 2 ): The electronic\\\\nconfiguration of oxygen atom is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4.\\\\nEach oxygen atom has 8 electrons, hence, in\\\\nO 2 molecule there are 16 electrons. The\\\\nelectronic configuration of O 2 molecule,\\\\ntherefore, is\\\\n\\\\nO : 2 KK ( 2 )^22\\\\n\\\\n2 2 2 2\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\nz\\\\ny\\\\n2\\\\nx\\\\n1\\\\ny\\\\n1\\\\nσ s σ s σ p\\\\np p p p\\\\n\\\\n( * ) ( )\\\\n\\\\n, * *\\\\n\\\\n2 2\\\\nπ^2 π π π\\\\n( x ≡ )( ≡ )\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ef\\\\uf8ef\\\\n\\\\nFrom the electronic configuration of O 2\\\\nmolecule it is clear that ten electrons are present\\\\nin bonding molecular orbitals and six electrons\\\\nare present in antibonding molecular orbitals.\\\\nIts bond order, therefore, is\\\\n[ b a] [ ]\\\\n\\\\n1 1\\\\n\\\\nBond order 10 6 2\\\\n2 2\\\\n\\\\n= N − N = − =\\\\n\\\\nSo in oxygen molecule, atoms are held\\\\nby a double bond. Moreover, it may be noted\\\\nthat it contains two unpaired electrons in\\\\nπ *2px and π *2py molecular orbitals,\\\\ntherefore, O 2 molecule should be\\\\nparamagnetic, a prediction that\\\\ncorresponds to experimental observation.\\\\nIn this way, the theory successfully explains\\\\nthe paramagnetic nature of oxygen.\\\\nSimilarly, the electronic configurations of\\\\nother homonuclear diatomic molecules of the\\\\nsecond row of the periodic table can be written.\\\\nIn Fig.4.21 are given the molecular orbital\\\\noccupancy and molecular properties for B 2\\\\nthrough Ne 2. The sequence of MOs and their\\\\nelectron population are shown. The bond\\\\nenergy, bond length, bond order, magnetic\\\\nproperties and valence electron configuration\\\\nappear below the orbital diagrams.\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^131\\\\n\\\\n4.9 Hydrogen Bonding\\\\n\\\\nNitrogen, oxygen and fluorine are the higly\\\\nelectronegative elements. When they are\\\\nattached to a hydrogen atom to form covalent\\\\nbond, the electrons of the covalent bond are\\\\nshifted towards the more electronegative atom.\\\\nThis partially positively charged hydrogen\\\\natom forms a bond with the other more\\\\nelectronegative atom. This bond is known as\\\\nhydrogen bond and is weaker than the\\\\ncovalent bond. For example, in HF molecule,\\\\nthe hydrogen bond exists between hydrogen\\\\natom of one molecule and fluorine atom of\\\\nanother molecule as depicted below :\\\\n− − −H – Fδ+ δ−− − −H – Fδ+ δ−− − −H – Fδ+ δ −\\\\nHere, hydrogen bond acts as a bridge between\\\\ntwo atoms which holds one atom by covalent\\\\nbond and the other by hydrogen bond.\\\\nHydrogen bond is represented by a dotted line\\\\n(– – –) while a solid line represents the covalent\\\\nbond. Thus, hydrogen bond can be defined\\\\nas the attractive force which binds\\\\nhydrogen atom of one molecule with the\\\\nelectronegative atom (F, O or N) of another\\\\nmolecule.\\\\n4.9.1 Cause of Formation of Hydrogen\\\\nBond\\\\nWhen hydrogen is bonded to strongly\\\\nelectronegative element ‘X’, the electron pair\\\\nshared between the two atoms moves far away\\\\nfrom hydrogen atom. As a result the hydrogen\\\\natom becomes highly electropositive with\\\\nrespect to the other atom ‘X’. Since there is\\\\ndisplacement of electrons towards X, the\\\\nhydrogen acquires fractional positive charge\\\\n(δ +) while ‘X’ attain fractional negative charge\\\\nFig.4.21 MO occupancy and molecular properties for B 2 through Ne 2.\\\\n\\\\n132 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nCHEMICAL BONDING AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE^133\\\\n\\\\nThe VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on\\\\nthe assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far\\\\napart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions\\\\nbetween lone pairs and lone pairs ; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and\\\\nbonding pairs. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp\\\\nThe valence bond (VB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the\\\\nenergetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent.\\\\nBasically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For\\\\nexample the formation of the H 2 molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of\\\\nthe 1 s orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential\\\\nenergy of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the\\\\nequilibrium inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any\\\\nattempt to bring the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent\\\\ndestabilization of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the\\\\nnuclei increases which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual\\\\nbond enthalpy and bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables\\\\nhave to be taken into account.\\\\nFor explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced\\\\nthe concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp , sp^2 , sp^3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals\\\\nof Be, B,C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules\\\\nlike BeCl 2 , BCl 3 , CH 4 , NH 3 and H 2 O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in\\\\nmolecules like C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 4.\\\\nThe molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination\\\\nand arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the\\\\nmolecule as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of\\\\natomic orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron\\\\ndensity between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals.\\\\nAntibonding molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei\\\\nand have more energy than the individual atomic orbitals.\\\\nThe electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the\\\\nmolecular orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the\\\\nPauli exclusion principle and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals.\\\\nMolecules are said to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is\\\\ngreater than that in antibonding molecular orbitals.\\\\nHydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly\\\\nelectronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two\\\\nor more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within\\\\nthe same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties\\\\nof many compounds.\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n4.1 Explain the formation of a chemical bond.\\\\n4.2 Write Lewis dot symbols for atoms of the following elements : Mg, Na, B, O, N, Br.\\\\n4.3 Write Lewis symbols for the following atoms and ions:\\\\nS and S2–; Al and Al3+; H and H–\\\\n4.4 Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules and ions :\\\\nH 2 S, SiCl 4 , BeF 2 , CO 32 −, HCOOH\\\\n\\\\n134 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n4.5 Define octet rule.

For example, an individual\\\\nmolecule of a liquid does not boil but the bulk boils.\\\\nCollection of water molecules have wetting properties;\\\\nindividual molecules do not wet. Water can exist as ice,\\\\nwhich is a solid; it can exist as liquid; or it can exist in\\\\nthe gaseous state as water vapour or steam. Physical\\\\nproperties of ice, water and steam are very different. In\\\\nall the three states of water chemical composition of water\\\\nremains the same i.e., H 2 O. Characteristics of the three\\\\nstates of water depend on the energies of molecules and\\\\non the manner in which water molecules aggregate. Same\\\\nis true for other substances also.\\\\nChemical properties of a substance do not change with\\\\nthe change of its physical state; but rate of chemical\\\\nreactions do depend upon the physical state. Many times\\\\nin calculations while dealing with data of experiments we\\\\nrequire knowledge of the state of matter. Therefore, it\\\\nbecomes necessary for a chemist to know the physical\\\\nThe snowflake falls, yet lays not long\\\\nIts feath’ry grasp on Mother Earth\\\\nEre Sun returns it to the vapors Whence it came,\\\\nOr to waters tumbling down the rocky slope.\\\\nRod O’ Connor\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 137\\\\n\\\\nlaws which govern the behaviour of matter in\\\\ndifferent states. In this unit, we will learn\\\\nmore about these three physical states of\\\\nmatter particularly liquid and gaseous states.\\\\nTo begin with, it is necessary to understand\\\\nthe nature of intermolecular forces, molecular\\\\ninteractions and effect of thermal energy on\\\\nthe motion of particles because a balance\\\\nbetween these determines the state of a\\\\nsubstance.\\\\n\\\\n5.1 Intermolecular Forces\\\\n\\\\nIntermolecular forces are the forces of\\\\nattraction and repulsion between interacting\\\\nparticles (atoms and molecules). This term\\\\ndoes not include the electrostatic forces that\\\\nexist between the two oppositely charged ions\\\\nand the forces that hold atoms of a molecule\\\\ntogether i.e., covalent bonds.\\\\nAttractive intermolecular forces are known\\\\nas van der Waals forces, in honour of Dutch\\\\nscientist Johannes van der Waals (1837-\\\\n1923), who explained the deviation of real\\\\ngases from the ideal behaviour through these\\\\nforces. We will learn about this later in this\\\\nunit. van der Waals forces vary considerably\\\\nin magnitude and include dispersion forces\\\\nor London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and\\\\ndipole-induced dipole forces. A particularly\\\\nstrong type of dipole-dipole interaction is\\\\nhydrogen bonding. Only a few elements can\\\\nparticipate in hydrogen bond formation,\\\\ntherefore it is treated as a separate\\\\ncategory. We have already learnt about this\\\\ninteraction in Unit 4.\\\\nAt this point, it is important to note that\\\\nattractive forces between an ion and a dipole\\\\nare known as ion-dipole forces and these are\\\\nnot van der Waals forces. We will now learn\\\\nabout different types of van der Waals forces.\\\\n5.1.1 Dispersion Forces or London Forces\\\\nAtoms and nonpolar molecules are electrically\\\\nsymmetrical and have no dipole moment\\\\nbecause their electronic charge cloud is\\\\nsymmetrically distributed. But a dipole may\\\\ndevelop momentarily even in such atoms and\\\\nmolecules. This can be understood as follows.\\\\nSuppose we have two atoms ‘A’ and ‘B’ in the\\\\nclose vicinity of each other (Fig. 5.1a). It may\\\\nso happen that momentarily electronic charge\\\\ndistribution in one of the atoms, say ‘A’,\\\\nbecomes unsymmetrical i.e., the charge cloud\\\\nis more on one side than the other (Fig. 5.1 b\\\\nand c). This results in the development of\\\\ninstantaneous dipole on the atom ‘A’ for a very\\\\nshort time. This instantaneous or transient\\\\ndipole distorts the electron density of the\\\\nother atom ‘B’, which is close to it and as a\\\\nconsequence a dipole is induced in the\\\\natom ‘B’.\\\\nThe temporary dipoles of atom ‘A’ and ‘B’\\\\nattract each other. Similarly temporary dipoles\\\\nare induced in molecules also. This force of\\\\nattraction was first proposed by the German\\\\nphysicist Fritz London, and for this reason\\\\nforce of attraction between two temporary\\\\nFig. 5.1 Dispersion forces or London forces\\\\nbetween atoms.\\\\n\\\\n138 CHEMISTRY\\\\ndipoles is known as London force. Another\\\\nname for this force is dispersion force. These\\\\nforces are always attractive and interaction\\\\nenergy is inversely proportional to the sixth\\\\npower of the distance between two interacting\\\\nparticles (i.e., 1/ r^6 where r is the distance\\\\nbetween two particles). These forces are\\\\nimportant only at short distances (~500 pm)\\\\nand their magnitude depends on the\\\\npolarisability of the particle.\\\\n\\\\n5.1.2 Dipole - Dipole Forces\\\\n\\\\nDipole-dipole forces act between the molecules\\\\npossessing permanent dipole. Ends of the\\\\ndipoles possess “partial charges” and these\\\\ncharges are shown by Greek letter delta (δ).\\\\nPartial charges are always less than the unit\\\\nelectronic charge (1.6×10–19 C). The polar\\\\nmolecules interact with neighbouring\\\\nmolecules. Fig 5.2 (a) shows electron cloud\\\\ndistribution in the dipole of hydrogen chloride\\\\nand Fig. 5.2 (b) shows dipole-dipole interaction\\\\nbetween two HCl molecules. This interaction\\\\nis stronger than the London forces but is\\\\nweaker than ion-ion interaction because only\\\\npartial charges are involved. The attractive\\\\nforce decreases with the increase of distance\\\\nbetween the dipoles. As in the above case here\\\\nalso, the interaction energy is inversely\\\\nproportional to distance between polar\\\\nmolecules. Dipole-dipole interaction energy\\\\nbetween stationary polar molecules (as in\\\\nsolids) is proportional to 1/ r^3 and that\\\\nbetween rotating polar molecules is\\\\n\\\\nproportional to 1/ r^6 , where r is the distance\\\\nbetween polar molecules. Besides dipole-\\\\ndipole interaction, polar molecules can\\\\ninteract by London forces also. Thus\\\\ncumulative effect is that the total of\\\\nintermolecular forces in polar molecules\\\\nincrease.\\\\n5.1.3 Dipole–Induced Dipole Forces\\\\nThis type of attractive forces operate between\\\\nthe polar molecules having permanent dipole\\\\nand the molecules lacking permanent dipole.\\\\nPermanent dipole of the polar molecule\\\\ninduces dipole on the electrically neutral\\\\nmolecule by deforming its electronic cloud\\\\n(Fig. 5.3). Thus an induced dipole is developed\\\\nin the other molecule. In this case also\\\\ninteraction energy is proportional to 1/ r^6\\\\nwhere r is the distance between two\\\\nmolecules. Induced dipole moment depends\\\\nupon the dipole moment present in the\\\\npermanent dipole and the polarisability of the\\\\nelectrically neutral molecule. We have already\\\\nlearnt in Unit 4 that molecules of larger size\\\\ncan be easily polarized. High polarisability\\\\nincreases the strength of attractive\\\\ninteractions.\\\\nFig. 5.2(a) Distribution of electron cloud in HCl –\\\\na polar molecule, (b) Dipole-dipole\\\\ninteraction between two HCl molecules\\\\nFig. 5.3 Dipole - induced dipole interaction\\\\nbetween permanent dipole and induced\\\\ndipole\\\\nIn this case also cumulative effect of\\\\ndispersion forces and dipole-induced dipole\\\\ninteractions exists.\\\\n5.1.4 Hydrogen bond\\\\nAs already mentioned in section (5.1); this is\\\\nspecial case of dipole-dipole interaction. We\\\\nhave already learnt about this in Unit 4. This\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 139\\\\n\\\\nis found in the molecules in which highly polar\\\\nN–H, O–H or H–F bonds are present. Although\\\\nhydrogen bonding is regarded as being limited\\\\nto N, O and F; but species such as Cl^ may\\\\nalso participate in hydrogen bonding. Energy\\\\nof hydrogen bond varies between 10 to 100\\\\nkJ mol–1. This is quite a significant amount of\\\\nenergy; therefore, hydrogen bonds are\\\\npowerful force in determining the structure and\\\\nproperties of many compounds, for example\\\\nproteins and nucleic acids. Strength of the\\\\nhydrogen bond is determined by the coulombic\\\\ninteraction between the lone-pair electrons of\\\\nthe electronegative atom of one molecule and\\\\nthe hydrogen atom of other molecule.\\\\nFollowing diagram shows the formation of\\\\nhydrogen bond.\\\\n\\\\nH F H F\\\\n\\\\nδ δ δ δ + − + −\\\\n− ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ −\\\\nIntermolecular forces discussed so far are\\\\nall attractive. Molecules also exert repulsive\\\\nforces on one another. When two molecules\\\\nare brought into close contact with each other,\\\\nthe repulsion between the electron clouds and\\\\nthat between the nuclei of two molecules comes\\\\ninto play. Magnitude of the repulsion rises very\\\\nrapidly as the distance separating the\\\\nmolecules decreases. This is the reason that\\\\nliquids and solids are hard to compress. In\\\\nthese states molecules are already in close\\\\ncontact; therefore they resist further\\\\ncompression; as that would result in the\\\\nincrease of repulsive interactions.\\\\n\\\\n5.2 Thermal Energy\\\\n\\\\nThermal energy is the energy of a body arising\\\\nfrom motion of its atoms or molecules. It is\\\\ndirectly proportional to the temperature of the\\\\nsubstance. It is the measure of average\\\\nkinetic energy of the particles of the matter\\\\nand is thus responsible for movement of\\\\nparticles. This movement of particles is called\\\\nthermal motion.\\\\n\\\\n5.3 Intermolecular Forces vs Thermal Interactions\\\\n\\\\nWe have already learnt that intermolecular\\\\nforces tend to keep the molecules together but\\\\nthermal energy of the molecules tends to keep\\\\nthem apart. Three states of matter are the result\\\\nof balance between intermolecular forces and\\\\nthe thermal energy of the molecules.\\\\nWhen molecular interactions are very\\\\nweak, molecules do not cling together to make\\\\nliquid or solid unless thermal energy is\\\\nreduced by lowering the temperature. Gases\\\\ndo not liquify on compression only, although\\\\nmolecules come very close to each other and\\\\nintermolecular forces operate to the maximum.\\\\nHowever, when thermal energy of molecules\\\\nis reduced by lowering the temperature; the\\\\ngases can be very easily liquified.\\\\nPredominance of thermal energy and the\\\\nmolecular interaction energy of a substance\\\\nin three states is depicted as follows :\\\\nWe have already learnt the cause for the\\\\nexistence of the three states of matter. Now\\\\nwe will learn more about gaseous and liquid\\\\nstates and the laws which govern the\\\\nbehaviour of matter in these states. We shall\\\\ndeal with the solid state in class XII.\\\\n\\\\n5.4 The Gaseous State\\\\n\\\\nThis is the simplest state of matter.\\\\nThroughout our life we remain immersed in\\\\nthe ocean of air which is a mixture of gases.\\\\nWe spend our life in the lowermost layer of\\\\nthe atmosphere called troposphere, which is\\\\nheld to the surface of the earth by gravitational\\\\nforce. The thin layer of atmosphere is vital to\\\\nour life. It shields us from harmful radiations\\\\nand contains substances like dioxygen,\\\\ndinitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, etc.\\\\nLet us now focus our attention on the\\\\nbehaviour of substances which exist in the\\\\ngaseous state under normal conditions of\\\\ntemperature and pressure. A look at the\\\\nperiodic table shows that only eleven elements\\\\n\\\\n140 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nexist as gases under normal conditions\\\\n(Fig 5.4).\\\\n\\\\nThe gaseous state is characterized by the\\\\nfollowing physical properties.\\\\n\\\\nGases are highly compressible.\\\\n\\\\nGases exert pressure equally in all\\\\n    directions.\\\\n\\\\nGases have much lower density than the\\\\n    solids and liquids.\\\\n\\\\nThe volume and the shape of gases are\\\\n    not fixed. These assume volume and shape\\\\n    of the container.\\\\n\\\\nGases mix evenly and completely in all\\\\n    proportions without any mechanical aid.\\\\n    Simplicity of gases is due to the fact that\\\\nthe forces of interaction between their\\\\nmolecules are negligible. Their behaviour is\\\\ngoverned by same general laws, which were\\\\ndiscovered as a result of their experimental\\\\nstudies. These laws are relationships between\\\\nmeasurable properties of gases. Some of these\\\\nproperties like pressure, volume, temperature\\\\nand mass are very important because\\\\nrelationships between these variables describe\\\\nstate of the gas. Interdependence of these\\\\nvariables leads to the formulation of gas laws.\\\\nIn the next section we will learn about gas\\\\nlaws.\\\\n\\\\n5.5 The Gas Laws\\\\n\\\\nThe gas laws which we will study now are the\\\\nresult of research carried on for several\\\\n\\\\ncenturies on the physical properties of gases.\\\\nThe first reliable measurement on properties\\\\nof gases was made by Anglo-Irish scientist\\\\nRobert Boyle in 1662. The law which he\\\\nformulated is known as Boyle’s Law. Later\\\\non attempts to fly in air with the help of hot\\\\nair balloons motivated Jaccques Charles and\\\\nJoseph Lewis Gay Lussac to discover\\\\nadditional gas laws. Contribution from\\\\nAvogadro and others provided lot of\\\\ninformation about gaseous state.\\\\n5.5.1 Boyle’s Law (Pressure - Volume\\\\nRelationship)\\\\nOn the basis of his experiments, Robert Boyle\\\\nreached to the conclusion that at constant\\\\ntemperature, the pressure of a fixed\\\\namount (i.e., number of moles n ) of gas\\\\nvaries inversely with its volume. This is\\\\nknown as Boyle’s law. Mathematically, it can\\\\nbe written as\\\\np\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\n∝ ( at constant T and n ) (5.1)\\\\n⇒ p\\\\nV\\\\n= k\\\\n\\\\n1 (5.2)\\\\n\\\\nwhere k 1 is the proportionality constant. The\\\\nvalue of constant k 1 depends upon the\\\\namount of the gas, temperature of the gas\\\\nand the units in which p and V are expressed.\\\\nOn rearranging equation (5.2) we obtain\\\\npV = k 1 (5.3)\\\\nIt means that at constant temperature,\\\\nproduct of pressure and volume of a fixed\\\\namount of gas is constant.\\\\nIf a fixed amount of gas at constant\\\\ntemperature T occupying volume V 1 at\\\\npressure p 1 undergoes expansion, so that\\\\nvolume becomes V 2 and pressure becomes p 2 ,\\\\nthen according to Boyle’s law :\\\\np 1 V 1 = p 2 V 2 = constant (5.4)\\\\n\\\\np\\\\np\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n= (5.5)\\\\n\\\\nFig. 5.4 Eleven elements that exist as gases\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 141\\\\n\\\\nFigure 5.5 shows two conventional ways\\\\nof graphically presenting Boyle’s law.\\\\nFig. 5.5 (a) is the graph of equation (5.3) at\\\\ndifferent temperatures. The value of k 1 for each\\\\ncurve is different because for a given mass of\\\\ngas, it varies only with temperature. Each\\\\ncurve corresponds to a different constant\\\\ntemperature and is known as an', 'between the following atoms to form\\\\ncations and anions : (a) K and S (b) Ca and O (c) Al and N.\\\\n4.15 Although both CO 2 and H 2 O are triatomic molecules, the shape of H 2 O molecule\\\\nis bent while that of CO 2 is linear.

For example, an individual\\\\nmolecule of a liquid does not boil but the bulk boils.\\\\nCollection of water molecules have wetting properties;\\\\nindividual molecules do not wet. Water can exist as ice,\\\\nwhich is a solid; it can exist as liquid; or it can exist in\\\\nthe gaseous state as water vapour or steam. Physical\\\\nproperties of ice, water and steam are very different. In\\\\nall the three states of water chemical composition of water\\\\nremains the same i.e., H 2 O. Characteristics of the three\\\\nstates of water depend on the energies of molecules and\\\\non the manner in which water molecules aggregate. Same\\\\nis true for other substances also.\\\\nChemical properties of a substance do not change with\\\\nthe change of its physical state; but rate of chemical\\\\nreactions do depend upon the physical state. Many times\\\\nin calculations while dealing with data of experiments we\\\\nrequire knowledge of the state of matter. Therefore, it\\\\nbecomes necessary for a chemist to know the physical\\\\nThe snowflake falls, yet lays not long\\\\nIts feath’ry grasp on Mother Earth\\\\nEre Sun returns it to the vapors Whence it came,\\\\nOr to waters tumbling down the rocky slope.\\\\nRod O’ Connor\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 137\\\\n\\\\nlaws which govern the behaviour of matter in\\\\ndifferent states. In this unit, we will learn\\\\nmore about these three physical states of\\\\nmatter particularly liquid and gaseous states.\\\\nTo begin with, it is necessary to understand\\\\nthe nature of intermolecular forces, molecular\\\\ninteractions and effect of thermal energy on\\\\nthe motion of particles because a balance\\\\nbetween these determines the state of a\\\\nsubstance.\\\\n\\\\n5.1 Intermolecular Forces\\\\n\\\\nIntermolecular forces are the forces of\\\\nattraction and repulsion between interacting\\\\nparticles (atoms and molecules). This term\\\\ndoes not include the electrostatic forces that\\\\nexist between the two oppositely charged ions\\\\nand the forces that hold atoms of a molecule\\\\ntogether i.e., covalent bonds.\\\\nAttractive intermolecular forces are known\\\\nas van der Waals forces, in honour of Dutch\\\\nscientist Johannes van der Waals (1837-\\\\n1923), who explained the deviation of real\\\\ngases from the ideal behaviour through these\\\\nforces. We will learn about this later in this\\\\nunit. van der Waals forces vary considerably\\\\nin magnitude and include dispersion forces\\\\nor London forces, dipole-dipole forces, and\\\\ndipole-induced dipole forces. A particularly\\\\nstrong type of dipole-dipole interaction is\\\\nhydrogen bonding. Only a few elements can\\\\nparticipate in hydrogen bond formation,\\\\ntherefore it is treated as a separate\\\\ncategory. We have already learnt about this\\\\ninteraction in Unit 4.\\\\nAt this point, it is important to note that\\\\nattractive forces between an ion and a dipole\\\\nare known as ion-dipole forces and these are\\\\nnot van der Waals forces. We will now learn\\\\nabout different types of van der Waals forces.\\\\n5.1.1 Dispersion Forces or London Forces\\\\nAtoms and nonpolar molecules are electrically\\\\nsymmetrical and have no dipole moment\\\\nbecause their electronic charge cloud is\\\\nsymmetrically distributed. But a dipole may\\\\ndevelop momentarily even in such atoms and\\\\nmolecules. This can be understood as follows.\\\\nSuppose we have two atoms ‘A’ and ‘B’ in the\\\\nclose vicinity of each other (Fig. 5.1a). It may\\\\nso happen that momentarily electronic charge\\\\ndistribution in one of the atoms, say ‘A’,\\\\nbecomes unsymmetrical i.e., the charge cloud\\\\nis more on one side than the other (Fig. 5.1 b\\\\nand c). This results in the development of\\\\ninstantaneous dipole on the atom ‘A’ for a very\\\\nshort time. This instantaneous or transient\\\\ndipole distorts the electron density of the\\\\nother atom ‘B’, which is close to it and as a\\\\nconsequence a dipole is induced in the\\\\natom ‘B’.\\\\nThe temporary dipoles of atom ‘A’ and ‘B’\\\\nattract each other. Similarly temporary dipoles\\\\nare induced in molecules also. This force of\\\\nattraction was first proposed by the German\\\\nphysicist Fritz London, and for this reason\\\\nforce of attraction between two temporary\\\\nFig. 5.1 Dispersion forces or London forces\\\\nbetween atoms.\\\\n\\\\n138 CHEMISTRY\\\\ndipoles is known as London force. Another\\\\nname for this force is dispersion force. These\\\\nforces are always attractive and interaction\\\\nenergy is inversely proportional to the sixth\\\\npower of the distance between two interacting\\\\nparticles (i.e., 1/ r^6 where r is the distance\\\\nbetween two particles). These forces are\\\\nimportant only at short distances (~500 pm)\\\\nand their magnitude depends on the\\\\npolarisability of the particle.\\\\n\\\\n5.1.2 Dipole - Dipole Forces\\\\n\\\\nDipole-dipole forces act between the molecules\\\\npossessing permanent dipole. Ends of the\\\\ndipoles possess “partial charges” and these\\\\ncharges are shown by Greek letter delta (δ).\\\\nPartial charges are always less than the unit\\\\nelectronic charge (1.6×10–19 C). The polar\\\\nmolecules interact with neighbouring\\\\nmolecules. Fig 5.2 (a) shows electron cloud\\\\ndistribution in the dipole of hydrogen chloride\\\\nand Fig. 5.2 (b) shows dipole-dipole interaction\\\\nbetween two HCl molecules. This interaction\\\\nis stronger than the London forces but is\\\\nweaker than ion-ion interaction because only\\\\npartial charges are involved. The attractive\\\\nforce decreases with the increase of distance\\\\nbetween the dipoles. As in the above case here\\\\nalso, the interaction energy is inversely\\\\nproportional to distance between polar\\\\nmolecules. Dipole-dipole interaction energy\\\\nbetween stationary polar molecules (as in\\\\nsolids) is proportional to 1/ r^3 and that\\\\nbetween rotating polar molecules is\\\\n\\\\nproportional to 1/ r^6 , where r is the distance\\\\nbetween polar molecules. Besides dipole-\\\\ndipole interaction, polar molecules can\\\\ninteract by London forces also. Thus\\\\ncumulative effect is that the total of\\\\nintermolecular forces in polar molecules\\\\nincrease.\\\\n5.1.3 Dipole–Induced Dipole Forces\\\\nThis type of attractive forces operate between\\\\nthe polar molecules having permanent dipole\\\\nand the molecules lacking permanent dipole.\\\\nPermanent dipole of the polar molecule\\\\ninduces dipole on the electrically neutral\\\\nmolecule by deforming its electronic cloud\\\\n(Fig. 5.3). Thus an induced dipole is developed\\\\nin the other molecule. In this case also\\\\ninteraction energy is proportional to 1/ r^6\\\\nwhere r is the distance between two\\\\nmolecules. Induced dipole moment depends\\\\nupon the dipole moment present in the\\\\npermanent dipole and the polarisability of the\\\\nelectrically neutral molecule. We have already\\\\nlearnt in Unit 4 that molecules of larger size\\\\ncan be easily polarized. High polarisability\\\\nincreases the strength of attractive\\\\ninteractions.\\\\nFig. 5.2(a) Distribution of electron cloud in HCl –\\\\na polar molecule, (b) Dipole-dipole\\\\ninteraction between two HCl molecules\\\\nFig. 5.3 Dipole - induced dipole interaction\\\\nbetween permanent dipole and induced\\\\ndipole\\\\nIn this case also cumulative effect of\\\\ndispersion forces and dipole-induced dipole\\\\ninteractions exists.\\\\n5.1.4 Hydrogen bond\\\\nAs already mentioned in section (5.1); this is\\\\nspecial case of dipole-dipole interaction. We\\\\nhave already learnt about this in Unit 4. This\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 139\\\\n\\\\nis found in the molecules in which highly polar\\\\nN–H, O–H or H–F bonds are present. Although\\\\nhydrogen bonding is regarded as being limited\\\\nto N, O and F; but species such as Cl^ may\\\\nalso participate in hydrogen bonding. Energy\\\\nof hydrogen bond varies between 10 to 100\\\\nkJ mol–1. This is quite a significant amount of\\\\nenergy; therefore, hydrogen bonds are\\\\npowerful force in determining the structure and\\\\nproperties of many compounds, for example\\\\nproteins and nucleic acids. Strength of the\\\\nhydrogen bond is determined by the coulombic\\\\ninteraction between the lone-pair electrons of\\\\nthe electronegative atom of one molecule and\\\\nthe hydrogen atom of other molecule.\\\\nFollowing diagram shows the formation of\\\\nhydrogen bond.\\\\n\\\\nH F H F\\\\n\\\\nδ δ δ δ + − + −\\\\n− ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ −\\\\nIntermolecular forces discussed so far are\\\\nall attractive. Molecules also exert repulsive\\\\nforces on one another. When two molecules\\\\nare brought into close contact with each other,\\\\nthe repulsion between the electron clouds and\\\\nthat between the nuclei of two molecules comes\\\\ninto play. Magnitude of the repulsion rises very\\\\nrapidly as the distance separating the\\\\nmolecules decreases. This is the reason that\\\\nliquids and solids are hard to compress. In\\\\nthese states molecules are already in close\\\\ncontact; therefore they resist further\\\\ncompression; as that would result in the\\\\nincrease of repulsive interactions.\\\\n\\\\n5.2 Thermal Energy\\\\n\\\\nThermal energy is the energy of a body arising\\\\nfrom motion of its atoms or molecules. It is\\\\ndirectly proportional to the temperature of the\\\\nsubstance. It is the measure of average\\\\nkinetic energy of the particles of the matter\\\\nand is thus responsible for movement of\\\\nparticles. This movement of particles is called\\\\nthermal motion.\\\\n\\\\n5.3 Intermolecular Forces vs Thermal Interactions\\\\n\\\\nWe have already learnt that intermolecular\\\\nforces tend to keep the molecules together but\\\\nthermal energy of the molecules tends to keep\\\\nthem apart. Three states of matter are the result\\\\nof balance between intermolecular forces and\\\\nthe thermal energy of the molecules.\\\\nWhen molecular interactions are very\\\\nweak, molecules do not cling together to make\\\\nliquid or solid unless thermal energy is\\\\nreduced by lowering the temperature. Gases\\\\ndo not liquify on compression only, although\\\\nmolecules come very close to each other and\\\\nintermolecular forces operate to the maximum.\\\\nHowever, when thermal energy of molecules\\\\nis reduced by lowering the temperature; the\\\\ngases can be very easily liquified.\\\\nPredominance of thermal energy and the\\\\nmolecular interaction energy of a substance\\\\nin three states is depicted as follows :\\\\nWe have already learnt the cause for the\\\\nexistence of the three states of matter. Now\\\\nwe will learn more about gaseous and liquid\\\\nstates and the laws which govern the\\\\nbehaviour of matter in these states. We shall\\\\ndeal with the solid state in class XII.\\\\n\\\\n5.4 The Gaseous State\\\\n\\\\nThis is the simplest state of matter.\\\\nThroughout our life we remain immersed in\\\\nthe ocean of air which is a mixture of gases.\\\\nWe spend our life in the lowermost layer of\\\\nthe atmosphere called troposphere, which is\\\\nheld to the surface of the earth by gravitational\\\\nforce. The thin layer of atmosphere is vital to\\\\nour life. It shields us from harmful radiations\\\\nand contains substances like dioxygen,\\\\ndinitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, etc.\\\\nLet us now focus our attention on the\\\\nbehaviour of substances which exist in the\\\\ngaseous state under normal conditions of\\\\ntemperature and pressure. A look at the\\\\nperiodic table shows that only eleven elements\\\\n\\\\n140 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nexist as gases under normal conditions\\\\n(Fig 5.4).\\\\n\\\\nThe gaseous state is characterized by the\\\\nfollowing physical properties.\\\\n\\\\nGases are highly compressible.\\\\n\\\\nGases exert pressure equally in all\\\\n    directions.\\\\n\\\\nGases have much lower density than the\\\\n    solids and liquids.\\\\n\\\\nThe volume and the shape of gases are\\\\n    not fixed. These assume volume and shape\\\\n    of the container.\\\\n\\\\nGases mix evenly and completely in all\\\\n    proportions without any mechanical aid.\\\\n    Simplicity of gases is due to the fact that\\\\nthe forces of interaction between their\\\\nmolecules are negligible. Their behaviour is\\\\ngoverned by same general laws, which were\\\\ndiscovered as a result of their experimental\\\\nstudies. These laws are relationships between\\\\nmeasurable properties of gases. Some of these\\\\nproperties like pressure, volume, temperature\\\\nand mass are very important because\\\\nrelationships between these variables describe\\\\nstate of the gas. Interdependence of these\\\\nvariables leads to the formulation of gas laws.\\\\nIn the next section we will learn about gas\\\\nlaws.\\\\n\\\\n5.5 The Gas Laws\\\\n\\\\nThe gas laws which we will study now are the\\\\nresult of research carried on for several\\\\n\\\\ncenturies on the physical properties of gases.\\\\nThe first reliable measurement on properties\\\\nof gases was made by Anglo-Irish scientist\\\\nRobert Boyle in 1662. The law which he\\\\nformulated is known as Boyle’s Law. Later\\\\non attempts to fly in air with the help of hot\\\\nair balloons motivated Jaccques Charles and\\\\nJoseph Lewis Gay Lussac to discover\\\\nadditional gas laws. Contribution from\\\\nAvogadro and others provided lot of\\\\ninformation about gaseous state.\\\\n5.5.1 Boyle’s Law (Pressure - Volume\\\\nRelationship)\\\\nOn the basis of his experiments, Robert Boyle\\\\nreached to the conclusion that at constant\\\\ntemperature, the pressure of a fixed\\\\namount (i.e., number of moles n ) of gas\\\\nvaries inversely with its volume. This is\\\\nknown as Boyle’s law. Mathematically, it can\\\\nbe written as\\\\np\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\n∝ ( at constant T and n ) (5.1)\\\\n⇒ p\\\\nV\\\\n= k\\\\n\\\\n1 (5.2)\\\\n\\\\nwhere k 1 is the proportionality constant. The\\\\nvalue of constant k 1 depends upon the\\\\namount of the gas, temperature of the gas\\\\nand the units in which p and V are expressed.\\\\nOn rearranging equation (5.2) we obtain\\\\npV = k 1 (5.3)\\\\nIt means that at constant temperature,\\\\nproduct of pressure and volume of a fixed\\\\namount of gas is constant.\\\\nIf a fixed amount of gas at constant\\\\ntemperature T occupying volume V 1 at\\\\npressure p 1 undergoes expansion, so that\\\\nvolume becomes V 2 and pressure becomes p 2 ,\\\\nthen according to Boyle’s law :\\\\np 1 V 1 = p 2 V 2 = constant (5.4)\\\\n\\\\np\\\\np\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n= (5.5)\\\\n\\\\nFig. 5.4 Eleven elements that exist as gases\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 141\\\\n\\\\nFigure 5.5 shows two conventional ways\\\\nof graphically presenting Boyle’s law.\\\\nFig. 5.5 (a) is the graph of equation (5.3) at\\\\ndifferent temperatures. The value of k 1 for each\\\\ncurve is different because for a given mass of\\\\ngas, it varies only with temperature. Each\\\\ncurve corresponds to a different constant\\\\ntemperature and is known as an isotherm\\\\n(constant temperature plot). Higher curves\\\\ncorrespond to higher temperature. It should\\\\nbe noted that volume of the gas doubles if\\\\npressure is halved. Table 5.1 gives effect of\\\\npressure on volume of 0.09 mol of CO 2 at\\\\n300 K.\\\\nFig 5.5 (b) represents the graph between p\\\\nand\\\\n1\\\\nV. It is a straight line passing through\\\\norigin. However at high pressures, gases\\\\ndeviate from Boyle’s law and under such\\\\nconditions a straight line is not obtained in the\\\\ngraph.\\\\nExperiments of Boyle, in a quantitative\\\\nmanner prove that gases are highly\\\\ncompressible because when a given mass of a\\\\ngas is compressed, the same number of\\\\nmolecules occupy a smaller space. This means\\\\nthat gases become denser at high pressure. A\\\\nrelationship can be obtained between density\\\\nand pressure of a gas by using Boyle’s law:\\\\nBy definition, density ‘ d ’ is related to the\\\\nmass ‘ m ’ and the volume ‘ V ’ by the relation\\\\nd\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\nm\\\\n. If we put value of V in this equation\\\\n\\\\n142 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nd =\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\nm\\\\nk 1\\\\np = k′^ p\\\\nThis shows that at a constant temperature,\\\\npressure is directly proportional to the density\\\\nof a fixed mass of the gas.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 5.1\\\\nA balloon is filled with hydrogen at room\\\\ntemperature. It will burst if pressure\\\\nexceeds 0.2 bar. If at 1 bar pressure the\\\\ngas occupies 2.27 L volume, upto what\\\\nvolume can the balloon be expanded?\\\\nSolution\\\\nAccording to Boyle’s Law p 1 V 1 = p 2 V 2\\\\nIf p 1 is 1 bar, V 1 will be 2.27 L\\\\nIf p 2 = 0.2 bar, then V p V\\\\n(^2) p\\\\n1 1\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n⇒ =\\\\n\\\\nV 2\\\\n\\\\n1 2 27\\\\n\\\\n0 2\\\\n\\\\nbar L\\\\nbar\\\\n\\\\n=11.35 L\\\\n\\\\nSince balloon bursts at 0.2 bar pressure,\\\\nthe volume of balloon should be less than\\\\n11.35 L.\\\\n5.5.2 Charles’ Law (Temperature - Volume\\\\nRelationship)\\\\n\\\\nCharles and Gay Lussac performed several\\\\nexperiments on gases independently to\\\\nimprove upon hot air balloon technology.\\\\nTheir investigations showed that for a fixed\\\\nmass of a gas at constant pressure, volume\\\\nof a gas increases on increasing temperature\\\\nand decreases on cooling. They found that\\\\nfor each degree rise in temperature, volume\\\\n\\\\nof a gas increases by\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n273.15\\\\nof the original\\\\nvolume of the gas at 0 °C. Thus if volumes of\\\\nthe gas at 0 °C and at t °C are V 0 and V t\\\\nrespectively, then\\\\n\\\\nV V V\\\\n\\\\nV V\\\\n\\\\nt 0 0\\\\nt 0\\\\n\\\\n= +\\\\n\\\\nt\\\\n273.15\\\\n=\\\\nt\\\\n273.15\\\\n\\\\n⇒ \\\\uf8eb +\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\nV t = V 0\\\\n273.15 + t\\\\n273.15 (5.6)\\\\nAt this stage, we define a new scale of\\\\ntemperature such that t °C on new scale is given\\\\nby T = 273.15 + t and 0 °C will be given by\\\\nT 0 = 273.15. This new temperature scale is\\\\ncalled the Kelvin temperature scale or\\\\nAbsolute temperature scale.\\\\nThus 0°C on the celsius scale is equal to\\\\n273.15 K at the absolute scale. Note that\\\\ndegree sign is not used while writing the\\\\ntemperature in absolute temperature scale,\\\\ni.e., Kelvin scale. Kelvin scale of temperature\\\\nis also called Thermodynamic scale of\\\\ntemperature and is used in all scientific\\\\nworks.\\\\nThus we add 273 (more precisely 273.15)\\\\nto the celsius temperature to obtain\\\\ntemperature at Kelvin scale.\\\\nIf we write T t = 273.15 + t and T 0 = 273.15\\\\nin the equation (5.6) we obtain the\\\\nrelationship\\\\n\\\\nV V\\\\n\\\\nt (^0) T\\\\nt\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\nt\\\\n0\\\\n= t\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n(5.7)\\\\n\\\\nThus we can write a general equation as\\\\nfollows.\\\\nV\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n= (5.8)\\\\n\\\\n⇒ =\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n= = constant 2 (5.9)k\\\\nThus V = k 2 T (5.10)\\\\nThe value of constant k 2 is determined by\\\\nthe pressure of the gas, its amount and the\\\\nunits in which volume V is expressed.\\\\nEquation (5.10) is the mathematical\\\\nexpression for Charles’ law, which states that\\\\npressure remaining constant, the volume\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 143\\\\n\\\\nof a fixed mass of a gas is directly\\\\nproportional to its absolute temperature.\\\\nCharles found that for all gases, at any given\\\\npressure, graph of volume vs temperature (in\\\\ncelsius) is a straight line and on extending to\\\\nzero volume, each line intercepts the\\\\ntemperature axis at – 273.15 °C. Slopes of\\\\nlines obtained at different pressure are\\\\ndifferent but at zero volume all the lines meet\\\\nthe temperature axis at – 273.15 °C (Fig. 5.6).\\\\nEach line of the volume vs temperature\\\\ngraph is called isobar.\\\\nObservations of Charles can be interpreted\\\\nif we put the value of t in equation (5.6) as\\\\n- 273.15 °C. We can see that the volume of\\\\nthe gas at – 273.15 °C will be zero. This means\\\\nthat gas will not exist. In fact all the gases get\\\\nliquified before this temperature is reached.\\\\nThe lowest hypothetical or imaginary\\\\ntemperature at which gases are supposed to\\\\noccupy zero volume is called Absolute zero.\\\\n    All gases obey Charles’ law at very low\\\\npressures and high temperatures.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 5.2\\\\nOn a ship sailing in Pacific Ocean where\\\\ntemperature is 23.4°C, a balloon is filled\\\\nwith 2 L air.

The mathematical\\\\nrelationship between pressure and\\\\ntemperature was given by Joseph Gay Lussac\\\\nand is known as Gay Lussac’s law. It states\\\\nthat at constant volume, pressure of a fixed\\\\namount of a gas varies directly with the\\\\ntemperature. Mathematically,\\\\np T\\\\np\\\\nT\\\\n\\\\n⇒ =constant = k 3\\\\nThis relationship can be derived from\\\\nBoyle’s law and Charles’ Law. Pressure vs\\\\ntemperature (Kelvin) graph at constant molar\\\\nvolume is shown in Fig. 5.7. Each line of this\\\\ngraph is called isochore.\\\\n\\\\n144 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n5.5.4 Avogadro Law (Volume - Amount\\\\nRelationship)\\\\n\\\\nIn 1811 Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro\\\\ntried to combine conclusions of Dalton’s atomic\\\\ntheory and Gay Lussac’s law of combining\\\\nvolumes (Unit 1) which is now known as\\\\nAvogadro law. It states that equal volumes\\\\nof all gases under the same conditions of\\\\ntemperature and pressure contain equal\\\\nnumber of molecules. This means that as\\\\nlong as the temperature and pressure remain\\\\nconstant, the volume depends upon number\\\\nof molecules of the gas or in other words\\\\namount of the gas. Mathematically we can write\\\\n\\\\n(5.12)\\\\n\\\\nWhere m = mass of the gas under\\\\ninvestigation and M = molar mass\\\\nThus,\\\\nV = k 4 m\\\\nM\\\\n\\\\n(5.13)\\\\n\\\\nEquation (5.13) can be rearranged as\\\\nfollows :\\\\nM = k 4\\\\nm\\\\nM\\\\n= k 4 d (5.14)\\\\nThe previous standard is still often used, and applies to all chemistry data more than decade old. In this definition STP\\\\ndenotes the same temperature of 0°C (273.15 K), but a slightly higher pressure of 1 atm (101.325 kPa). One mole of any gas\\\\nof a combination of gases occupies 22.413996 L of volume at STP.\\\\nStandard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP), conditions are also used in some scientific works. SATP conditions\\\\nmeans 298.15 K and 1 bar (i.e., exactly 10^5 Pa). At SATP (1 bar and 298.15 K), the molar volume of an ideal gas is\\\\n24.789 L mol–1.\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 145\\\\n\\\\nHere ‘ d ’ is the density of the gas. We can conclude\\\\nfrom equation (5.14) that the density of a gas is\\\\ndirectly proportional to its molar mass.\\\\nA gas that follows Boyle’s law, Charles’ law\\\\nand Avogadro law strictly is called an ideal\\\\ngas. Such a gas is hypothetical. It is assumed\\\\nthat intermolecular forces are not present\\\\nbetween the molecules of an ideal gas. Real\\\\ngases follow these laws only under certain\\\\nspecific conditions when forces of interaction\\\\nare practically negligible. In all other situations\\\\nthese deviate from ideal behaviour. You will\\\\nlearn about the deviations later in this unit.\\\\n\\\\n5.6 Ideal Gas Equation\\\\n\\\\nThe three laws which we have learnt till now\\\\ncan be combined together in a single equation\\\\nwhich is known as ideal gas equation.\\\\nAt constant T and n; V ∝\\\\n\\\\nn\\\\n∝\\\\n\\\\np (5.15)\\\\n\\\\n⇒ V\\\\n\\\\nn\\\\n= R\\\\n\\\\np (5.16)\\\\nwhere R is proportionality constant. On\\\\nrearranging the equation (5.16) we obtain\\\\npV = n R T (5.17)\\\\n\\\\n⇒ R =\\\\n\\\\npV\\\\nTn\\\\n\\\\n(5.18)\\\\n\\\\nR is called gas constant. It is same for all gases.\\\\nTherefore it is also called Universal Gas\\\\nConstant. Equation (5.17) is called ideal gas\\\\nequation.\\\\nEquation (5.18) shows that the value of\\\\nR depends upon units in which p , V and T\\\\nare measured.

This assumption explains the\\\\n    great compressibility of gases.\\\\n- There is no force of attraction between the\\\\n    particles of a gas at ordinary temperature and\\\\n    pressure. The support for this assumption\\\\n    comes from the fact that gases expand and\\\\n    occupy all the space available to them.\\\\n- Particles of a gas are always in constant and\\\\n    random motion.

However at high pressures, gases\\\\ndeviate from Boyle’s law and under such\\\\nconditions a straight line is not obtained in the\\\\ngraph.\\\\nExperiments of Boyle, in a quantitative\\\\nmanner prove that gases are highly\\\\ncompressible because when a given mass of a\\\\ngas is compressed, the same number of\\\\nmolecules occupy a smaller space. This means\\\\nthat gases become denser at high pressure. A\\\\nrelationship can be obtained between density\\\\nand pressure of a gas by using Boyle’s law:\\\\nBy definition, density ‘ d ’ is related to the\\\\nmass ‘ m ’ and the volume ‘ V ’ by the relation\\\\nd\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\nm\\\\n.

This new temperature scale is\\\\ncalled the Kelvin temperature scale or\\\\nAbsolute temperature scale.\\\\nThus 0°C on the celsius scale is equal to\\\\n273.15 K at the absolute scale. Note that\\\\ndegree sign is not used while writing the\\\\ntemperature in absolute temperature scale,\\\\ni.e., Kelvin scale. Kelvin scale of temperature\\\\nis also called Thermodynamic scale of\\\\ntemperature and is used in all scientific\\\\nworks.\\\\nThus we add 273 (more precisely 273.15)\\\\nto the celsius temperature to obtain\\\\ntemperature at Kelvin scale.\\\\nIf we write T t = 273.15 + t and T 0 = 273.15\\\\nin the equation (5.6) we obtain the\\\\nrelationship\\\\n\\\\nV V\\\\n\\\\nt (^0) T\\\\nt\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\nt\\\\n0\\\\n= t\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n(5.7)\\\\n\\\\nThus we can write a general equation as\\\\nfollows.\\\\nV\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n= (5.8)\\\\n\\\\n⇒ =\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n= = constant 2 (5.9)k\\\\nThus V = k 2 T (5.10)\\\\nThe value of constant k 2 is determined by\\\\nthe pressure of the gas, its amount and the\\\\nunits in which volume V is expressed.\\\\nEquation (5.10) is the mathematical\\\\nexpression for Charles’ law, which states that\\\\npressure remaining constant, the volume\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 143\\\\n\\\\nof a fixed mass of a gas is directly\\\\nproportional to its absolute temperature.\\\\nCharles found that for all gases, at any given\\\\npressure, graph of volume vs temperature (in\\\\ncelsius) is a straight line and on extending to\\\\nzero volume, each line intercepts the\\\\ntemperature axis at – 273.15 °C. Slopes of\\\\nlines obtained at different pressure are\\\\ndifferent but at zero volume all the lines meet\\\\nthe temperature axis at – 273.15 °C (Fig. 5.6).\\\\nEach line of the volume vs temperature\\\\ngraph is called isobar.\\\\nObservations of Charles can be interpreted\\\\nif we put the value of t in equation (5.6) as\\\\n- 273.15 °C. We can see that the volume of\\\\nthe gas at – 273.15 °C will be zero. This means\\\\nthat gas will not exist. In fact all the gases get\\\\nliquified before this temperature is reached.\\\\nThe lowest hypothetical or imaginary\\\\ntemperature at which gases are supposed to\\\\noccupy zero volume is called Absolute zero.\\\\n    All gases obey Charles’ law at very low\\\\npressures and high temperatures.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 5.2\\\\nOn a ship sailing in Pacific Ocean where\\\\ntemperature is 23.4°C, a balloon is filled\\\\nwith 2 L air.

The mathematical\\\\nrelationship between pressure and\\\\ntemperature was given by Joseph Gay Lussac\\\\nand is known as Gay Lussac’s law.

It states that equal volumes\\\\nof all gases under the same conditions of\\\\ntemperature and pressure contain equal\\\\nnumber of molecules. This means that as\\\\nlong as the temperature and pressure remain\\\\nconstant, the volume depends upon number\\\\nof molecules of the gas or in other words\\\\namount of the gas. Mathematically we can write\\\\n\\\\n(5.12)\\\\n\\\\nWhere m = mass of the gas under\\\\ninvestigation and M = molar mass\\\\nThus,\\\\nV = k 4 m\\\\nM\\\\n\\\\n(5.13)\\\\n\\\\nEquation (5.13) can be rearranged as\\\\nfollows :\\\\nM = k 4\\\\nm\\\\nM\\\\n= k 4 d (5.14)\\\\nThe previous standard is still often used, and applies to all chemistry data more than decade old. In this definition STP\\\\ndenotes the same temperature of 0°C (273.15 K), but a slightly higher pressure of 1 atm (101.325 kPa). One mole of any gas\\\\nof a combination of gases occupies 22.413996 L of volume at STP.\\\\nStandard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP), conditions are also used in some scientific works. SATP conditions\\\\nmeans 298.15 K and 1 bar (i.e., exactly 10^5 Pa). At SATP (1 bar and 298.15 K), the molar volume of an ideal gas is\\\\n24.789 L mol–1.\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 145\\\\n\\\\nHere ‘ d ’ is the density of the gas. We can conclude\\\\nfrom equation (5.14) that the density of a gas is\\\\ndirectly proportional to its molar mass.\\\\nA gas that follows Boyle’s law, Charles’ law\\\\nand Avogadro law strictly is called an ideal\\\\ngas. Such a gas is hypothetical. It is assumed\\\\nthat intermolecular forces are not present\\\\nbetween the molecules of an ideal gas. Real\\\\ngases follow these laws only under certain\\\\nspecific conditions when forces of interaction\\\\nare practically negligible. In all other situations\\\\nthese deviate from ideal behaviour. You will\\\\nlearn about the deviations later in this unit.\\\\n\\\\n5.6 Ideal Gas Equation\\\\n\\\\nThe three laws which we have learnt till now\\\\ncan be combined together in a single equation\\\\nwhich is known as ideal gas equation.\\\\nAt constant T and n; V ∝\\\\n\\\\nn\\\\n∝\\\\n\\\\np (5.15)\\\\n\\\\n⇒ V\\\\n\\\\nn\\\\n= R\\\\n\\\\np (5.16)\\\\nwhere R is proportionality constant.

It is possible to show\\\\n          that though the individual speeds are\\\\n          changing, the distribution of speeds\\\\n          remains constant at a particular\\\\n          temperature.\\\\n       - If a molecule has variable speed, then it\\\\n          must have a variable kinetic energy.

In kinetic\\\\n          theory, it is assumed that average kinetic\\\\n          energy of the gas molecules is directly\\\\n          proportional to the absolute temperature.\\\\n          It is seen that on heating a gas at constant\\\\n          volume, the pressure increases. On heating\\\\n          the gas, kinetic energy of the particles\\\\n          increases and these strike the walls of the\\\\n          container more frequently, thus, exerting\\\\n          more pressure.\\\\n          Kinetic theory of gases allows us to derive\\\\n       theoretically, all the gas laws studied in the\\\\n       previous sections.

The pressure vs volume plot of\\\\nexperimental data (real gas) and that\\\\ntheoretically calculated from Boyle’s law (ideal\\\\ngas) should coincide. Fig 5.11 shows these\\\\nplots.

There is a significant deviation\\\\nfrom ideal behaviour. Two types of curves are\\\\nseen. In the curves for dihydrogen and helium,\\\\nas the pressure increases the value of pV also\\\\nincreases. The second type of plot is seen in\\\\nthe case of other gases like carbon monoxide\\\\nand methane. In these plots first there is a\\\\n\\\\nIt is found that real gases do not follow,\\\\nBoyle’s law, Charles law and Avogadro law\\\\nperfectly under all conditions. Now two\\\\nquestions arise.\\\\n(i) Why do gases deviate from the ideal\\\\nbehaviour?\\\\n(ii) What are the conditions under which gases\\\\ndeviate from ideality?\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 151\\\\n\\\\nWe get the answer of the first question if we\\\\nlook into postulates of kinetic theory once\\\\nagain. We find that two assumptions of the\\\\nkinetic theory do not hold good. These are\\\\n(a) There is no force of attraction between the\\\\nmolecules of a gas.\\\\n(b)Volume of the molecules of a gas is\\\\nnegligibly small in comparison to the space\\\\noccupied by the gas.\\\\nIf assumption (a) is correct, the gas will\\\\nnever liquify. However, we know that gases do\\\\nliquify when cooled and compressed. Also,\\\\nliquids formed are very difficult to compress.\\\\nThis means that forces of repulsion are\\\\npowerful enough and prevent squashing of\\\\nmolecules in tiny volume. If assumption (b) is\\\\ncorrect, the pressure vs volume graph of\\\\nexperimental data (real gas) and that\\\\ntheoritically calculated from Boyles law (ideal\\\\ngas) should coincide.\\\\nReal gases show deviations from ideal gas\\\\nlaw because molecules interact with each other.\\\\nAt high pressures molecules of gases are very\\\\nclose to each other. Molecular interactions start\\\\noperating. At high pressure, molecules do not\\\\nstrike the walls of the container with full impact\\\\nbecause these are dragged back by other\\\\nmolecules due to molecular attractive forces.\\\\nThis affects the pressure exerted by the\\\\nmolecules on the walls of the container. Thus,\\\\nthe pressure exerted by the gas is lower than\\\\nthe pressure exerted by the ideal gas.\\\\np p\\\\nn\\\\nideal real V\\\\n\\\\n= +\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\n( − )=\\\\n\\\\na\\\\nb R\\\\n2\\\\n2 (5.31)\\\\nEquation (5.31) is known as van der Waals\\\\nequation. In this equation n is number of moles\\\\nof the gas. Constants a and b are called van\\\\nder Waals constants and their value depends\\\\non the characteristic of a gas. Value of ‘a’ is\\\\nmeasure of magnitude of intermolecular\\\\nattractive forces within the gas and is\\\\nindependent of temperature and pressure.\\\\nAlso, at very low temperature,\\\\nintermolecular forces become significant. As\\\\nthe molecules travel with low average speed,\\\\nthese can be captured by one another due to\\\\nattractive forces. Real gases show ideal\\\\nbehaviour when conditions of temperature and\\\\npressure are such that the intermolecular\\\\nforces are practically negligible. The real gases\\\\nshow ideal behaviour when pressure\\\\napproaches zero.\\\\nThe deviation from ideal behaviour can be\\\\nmeasured in terms of compressibility factor\\\\nZ , which is the ratio of product pV and n R T.\\\\nMathematically\\\\nZ pV\\\\nn T\\\\n\\\\nR (5.32)\\\\n\\\\nFor ideal gas Z = 1 at all temperatures and\\\\npressures because pV = n R T. The graph of Z\\\\nvs p will be a straight line parallel to pressure\\\\naxis (Fig. 5.12, page 152). For gases which\\\\ndeviate from ideality, value of Z deviates from\\\\nunity. At very low pressures all gases shown\\\\nhave Z ≈ 1 and behave as ideal gas. At high\\\\npressure all the gases have Z > 1. These are\\\\nmore difficult to compress. At intermediate\\\\npressures, most gases have Z < 1. Thus gases\\\\nshow ideal behaviour when the volume\\\\ncorrection\\\\nterm\\\\nobserved\\\\npressure\\\\n\\\\n152 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\noccupied is large so that the volume of the\\\\nmolecules can be neglected in comparison\\\\nto it. In other words, the behaviour of the gas\\\\nbecomes more ideal when pressure is very low.\\\\nUpto what pressure a gas will follow the ideal\\\\ngas law, depends upon nature of the gas and\\\\nits temperature. The temperature at which a real\\\\ngas obeys ideal gas law over an appreciable\\\\nrange of pressure is called Boyle temperature\\\\nor Boyle point. Boyle point of a gas depends\\\\nupon its nature. Above their Boyle point, real\\\\ngases show positive deviations from ideality and\\\\nZ values are greater than one. The forces of\\\\nattraction between the molecules are very feeble.\\\\nBelow Boyle temperature real gases first show\\\\ndecrease in Z value with increasing pressure,\\\\nwhich reaches a minimum value. On further\\\\nincrease in pressure, the value of Z increases\\\\ncontinuously. Above explanation shows that at\\\\nlow pressure and high temperature gases show\\\\nideal behaviour.

On putting this value of\\\\nn T\\\\np\\\\n\\\\nin equation (5.33) we have Z\\\\n\\\\n= real\\\\nideal\\\\n\\\\n(5.34)\\\\n\\\\nFrom equation (5.34) we can see that\\\\ncompressibility factor is the ratio of actual\\\\nmolar volume of a gas to the molar volume of\\\\nit, if it were an ideal gas at that temperature\\\\nand pressure.\\\\nIn the following sections we will see that it\\\\nis not possible to distinguish between gaseous\\\\nstate and liquid state and that liquids may be\\\\nconsidered as continuation of gas phase into a\\\\nregion of small volumes and very high\\\\nmolecular attraction. We will also see how we\\\\ncan use isotherms of gases for predicting the\\\\nconditions for liquifaction of gases.\\\\n5.10 LIQUIFACTION OF GASES\\\\nFirst complete data on pressure-volume-\\\\ntemperature relations of a substance in both\\\\ngaseous and liquid state was obtained by\\\\nThomas Andrews on Carbon dioxide. He plotted\\\\nisotherms of carbon dioxide at various\\\\ntemperatures (Fig. 5.13). Later on it was found\\\\nthat real gases behave in the same manner as\\\\ncarbon dioxide. Andrews noticed that at high\\\\ntemperatures isotherms look like that of an\\\\nideal gas and the gas cannot be liquified even at\\\\nvery high pressure. As the temperature is\\\\nlowered, shape of the curve changes and data\\\\nshow considerable deviation from ideal\\\\nbehaviour. At 30.98°C carbon dioxide remains\\\\ngas upto 73 atmospheric pressure. (Point E in\\\\nFig. 5.13). At 73 atmospheric pressure, liquid\\\\ncarbon dioxide appears for the first time. The\\\\ntemperature 30.98°C is called critical\\\\ntemperature ( T C) of carbon dioxide. This is the\\\\nhighest temperature at which liquid carbon\\\\ndioxide is observed. Above this temperature it\\\\nis gas. Volume of one mole of the gas at critical\\\\ntemperature is called critical volume ( V C) and\\\\npressure at this temperature is called critical\\\\npressure ( p C). The critical temperature, pressure\\\\nand volume are called critical constants. Further\\\\nincrease in pressure simply compresses the\\\\nFig. 5.12 Variation of compressibility factor for\\\\nsome gases\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 153\\\\n\\\\nThus we see that a point like A in the Fig. 5.1 3\\\\nrepresents gaseous state. A point like D\\\\nrepresents liquid state and a point under the\\\\ndome shaped area represents existence of liquid\\\\nand gaseous carbon dioxide in equilibrium. All\\\\nthe gases upon compression at constant\\\\ntemperature (isothermal compression) show the\\\\nsame behaviour as shown by carbon dioxide.\\\\nAlso above discussion shows that gases should\\\\nbe cooled below their critical temperature for\\\\nliquification. Critical temperature of a gas is\\\\nhighest temperature at which liquifaction of the\\\\ngas first occurs. Liquifaction of so called\\\\npermanent gases (i.e., gases which show\\\\ncontinuous positive deviation in Z value)\\\\nrequires cooling as well as considerable\\\\ncompression. Compression brings the\\\\nmolecules in close vicinity and cooling slows\\\\ndown the movement of molecules therefore,\\\\nintermolecular interactions may hold the closely\\\\nand slowly moving molecules together and the\\\\ngas liquifies.\\\\nIt is possible to change a gas into liquid or\\\\na liquid into gas by a process in which always\\\\na single phase is present. For example in\\\\nFig. 5.13 we can move from point A to F\\\\nvertically by increasing the temperature, then\\\\nwe can reach the point G by compressing the\\\\ngas at the constant temperature along this\\\\nisotherm (isotherm at 31.1°C). The pressure\\\\nwill increase. Now we can move vertically down\\\\ntowards D by lowering the temperature. As\\\\nsoon as we cross the point H on the critical\\\\nisotherm we get liquid. We end up with liquid\\\\nbut in this series of changes we do not pass\\\\nthrough two-phase region. If process is carried\\\\nout at the critical temperature, substance\\\\nalways remains in one phase.\\\\nThus there is continuity between the\\\\ngaseous and liquid state. The term fluid is used\\\\nfor either a liquid or a gas to recognise this\\\\ncontinuity. Thus a liquid can be viewed as a\\\\nvery dense gas. Liquid and gas can be\\\\ndistinguished only when the fluid is below its\\\\ncritical temperature and its pressure and\\\\nvolume lie under the dome, since in that\\\\nsituation liquid and gas are in equilibrium and\\\\na surface separating the two phases is visible.\\\\nIn the absence of this surface there is no\\\\nliquid carbon dioxide and the curve represents\\\\nthe compressibility of the liquid. The steep line\\\\nrepresents the isotherm of liquid. Even a slight\\\\ncompression results in steep rise in pressure\\\\nindicating very low compressibility of the liquid.\\\\nBelow 30.98 °C, the behaviour of the gas on\\\\ncompression is quite different. At 21.5 °C,\\\\ncarbon dioxide remains as a gas only upto\\\\npoint B. At point B, liquid of a particular volume\\\\nappears. Further compression does not change\\\\nthe pressure. Liquid and gaseous carbon\\\\ndioxide coexist and further application of\\\\npressure results in the condensation of more\\\\ngas until the point C is reached. At point C, all\\\\nthe gas has been condensed and further\\\\napplication of pressure merely compresses the\\\\nliquid as shown by steep line. A slight\\\\ncompression from volume V 2 to V 3 results in\\\\nsteep rise in pressure from p 2 to p 3 (Fig. 5.13).\\\\nBelow 30.98 °C (critical temperature) each\\\\ncurve shows the similar trend. Only length of\\\\nthe horizontal line increases at lower\\\\ntemperatures. At critical point horizontal\\\\nportion of the isotherm merges into one point.\\\\nFig. 5.13Isotherms of carbon dioxide at various\\\\ntemperatures\\\\n\\\\n154 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nfundamental way of distinguishing between\\\\ntwo states. At critical temperature, liquid\\\\npasses into gaseous state imperceptibly and\\\\ncontinuously; the surface separating two\\\\nphases disappears (Section 5.11.1). A gas\\\\nbelow the critical temperature can be liquified\\\\nby applying pressure, and is called vapour of\\\\nthe substance. Carbon dioxide gas below its\\\\ncritical temperature is called carbon dioxide\\\\nvapour. Critical constants for some common\\\\nsubstances are given in Table 5.4.\\\\n\\\\nbetween them and under normal conditions\\\\nliquids are denser than gases.\\\\nMolecules of liquids are held together by\\\\nattractive intermolecular forces. Liquids have\\\\ndefinite volume because molecules do not\\\\nseparate from each other. However, molecules\\\\nof liquids can move past one another freely,\\\\ntherefore, liquids can flow, can be poured and\\\\ncan assume the shape of the container in which\\\\nthese are stored. In the following sections we\\\\nwill look into some of the physical properties\\\\nof the liquids such as vapour pressure, surface\\\\ntension and viscosity.\\\\n5.11.1 Vapour Pressure\\\\nIf an evacuated container is partially filled with\\\\na liquid, a portion of liquid evaporates to fill\\\\nthe remaining volume of the container with\\\\nvapour. Initially the liquid evaporates and\\\\npressure exerted by vapours on the walls of\\\\nthe container (vapour pressure) increases. After\\\\nsome time it becomes constant, an equilibrium\\\\nis established between liquid phase and\\\\nvapour phase. Vapour pressure at this stage\\\\nis known as equilibrium vapour pressure or\\\\nsaturated vapour pressure.. Since process of\\\\nvapourisation is temperature dependent; the\\\\ntemperature must be mentioned while\\\\nreporting the vapour pressure of a liquid.\\\\nWhen a liquid is heated in an open vessel,\\\\nthe liquid vapourises from the surface. At the\\\\ntemperature at which vapour pressure of the\\\\nliquid becomes equal to the external pressure,\\\\nvapourisation can occur throughout the bulk\\\\nof the liquid and vapours expand freely into\\\\nthe surroundings. The condition of free\\\\nvapourisation throughout the liquid is called\\\\nboiling. The temperature at which vapour\\\\npressure of liquid is equal to the external\\\\npressure is called boiling temperature at that\\\\npressure. Vapour pressure of some common\\\\nliquids at various temperatures is given in\\\\n(Fig. 5.14, page 155). At 1 atm pressure boiling\\\\ntemperature is called normal boiling point.\\\\nIf pressure is 1 bar then the boiling point is\\\\ncalled standard boiling point of the liquid.\\\\nStandard boiling point of the liquid is slightly\\\\nlower than the normal boiling point because\\\\nTable 5.4 Critical Constants for Some\\\\nSubstances\\\\nProblem 5.5\\\\nGases possess characteristic critical\\\\ntemperature which depends upon the\\\\nmagnitude of intermolecular forces\\\\nbetween the gas particles. Critical\\\\ntemperatures of ammonia and carbon\\\\ndioxide are 405.5 K and 304.10 K\\\\nrespectively. Which of these gases will\\\\nliquify first when you start cooling from\\\\n500 K to their critical temperature?\\\\nSolution\\\\nAmmonia will liquify first because its\\\\ncritical temperature will be reached first.\\\\nLiquifaction of CO 2 will require more\\\\ncooling.\\\\n\\\\n5.11Liquid State\\\\n\\\\nIntermolecular forces are stronger in liquid\\\\nstate than in gaseous state. Molecules in liquids\\\\nare so close that there is very little empty space\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 155\\\\n\\\\n1 bar pressure is slightly less than 1 atm\\\\npressure. The normal boiling point of water is\\\\n100 °C (373 K), its standard boiling point is\\\\n99.6 °C (372.6 K).\\\\nAt high altitudes atmospheric pressure is\\\\nlow. Therefore liquids at high altitudes boil at\\\\nlower temperatures in comparison to that at\\\\nsea level. Since water boils at low temperature\\\\non hills, the pressure cooker is used for\\\\ncooking food. In hospitals surgical instruments\\\\nare sterilized in autoclaves in which boiling\\\\npoint of water is increased by increasing the\\\\npressure above the atmospheric pressure by\\\\nusing a weight covering the vent.\\\\nBoiling does not occur when liquid is\\\\nheated in a closed vessel. On heating\\\\ncontinuously vapour pressure increases. At\\\\nfirst a clear boundary is visible between liquid\\\\nand vapour phase because liquid is more dense\\\\nthan vapour. As the temperature increases\\\\nmore and more molecules go to vapour phase\\\\nand density of vapours rises. At the same time\\\\nliquid becomes less dense. It expands because\\\\nmolecules move apart. When density of liquid\\\\nand vapours becomes the same; the clear\\\\nboundary between liquid and vapours\\\\ndisappears. This temperature is called critical\\\\ntemperature about which we have already\\\\ndiscussed in section 5.10.\\\\n5.11.2 Surface Tension\\\\nIt is well known fact that liquids assume the\\\\nshape of the container. Why is it then small\\\\ndrops of mercury form spherical bead instead\\\\nof spreading on the surface. Why do particles\\\\nof soil at the bottom of river remain separated\\\\nbut they stick together when taken out? Why\\\\ndoes a liquid rise (or fall) in a thin capillary as\\\\nsoon as the capillary touches the surface of\\\\nthe liquid? All these phenomena are caused\\\\ndue to the characteristic property of liquids,\\\\ncalled surface tension. A molecule in the bulk\\\\nof liquid experiences equal intermolecular\\\\nforces from all sides. The molecule, therefore\\\\ndoes not experience any net force. But for the\\\\nmolecule on the surface of liquid, net attractive\\\\nforce is towards the interior of the liquid (Fig.\\\\n5.15), due to the molecules below it. Since there\\\\nare no molecules above it.\\\\nLiquids tend to minimize their surface area.\\\\nThe molecules on the surface experience a net\\\\ndownward force and have more energy than\\\\nFig. 5.14Vapour pressure vs temperature curve\\\\nof some common', 'molecules will stop and gases will settle\\\\n          down. This is contrary to what is actually\\\\n          observed.\\\\n       - At any particular time, different particles\\\\n          in the gas have different speeds and hence\\\\n          different kinetic energies. This assumption\\\\n          is reasonable because as the particles\\\\n          collide, we expect their speed to change.\\\\n          Even if initial speed of all the particles was\\\\n          same, the molecular collisions will disrupt\\\\n          this uniformity. Consequently, the particles\\\\n          must have different speeds, which go on\\\\n          changing constantly. It is possible to show\\\\n          that though the individual speeds are\\\\n          changing, the distribution of speeds\\\\n          remains constant at a particular\\\\n          temperature.\\\\n       - If a molecule has variable speed, then it\\\\n          must have a variable kinetic energy. Under\\\\n          these circumstances, we can talk only\\\\n          about average kinetic energy. In kinetic\\\\n          theory, it is assumed that average kinetic\\\\n          energy of the gas molecules is directly\\\\n          proportional to the absolute temperature.\\\\n          It is seen that on heating a gas at constant\\\\n          volume, the pressure increases. On heating\\\\n          the gas, kinetic energy of the particles\\\\n          increases and these strike the walls of the\\\\n          container more frequently, thus, exerting\\\\n          more pressure.\\\\n          Kinetic theory of gases allows us to derive\\\\n       theoretically, all the gas laws studied in the\\\\n       previous sections. Calculations and predictions\\\\n\\\\n150 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nbased on kinetic theory of gases agree very well\\\\nwith the experimental observations and thus\\\\nestablish the correctness of this model.\\\\n\\\\n5.9 Behaviour of Real Gases: Deviation from Ideal Gas Behaviour\\\\n\\\\nnegative deviation from ideal behaviour, the pV\\\\nvalue decreases with increase in pressure and\\\\nreaches to a minimum value characteristic of\\\\na gas. After that pV value starts increasing. The\\\\ncurve then crosses the line for ideal gas and\\\\nafter that shows positive deviation\\\\ncontinuously.

There is a significant deviation\\\\nfrom ideal behaviour. Two types of curves are\\\\nseen. In the curves for dihydrogen and helium,\\\\nas the pressure increases the value of pV also\\\\nincreases.

We will also see how we\\\\ncan use isotherms of gases for predicting the\\\\nconditions for liquifaction of gases.\\\\n5.10 LIQUIFACTION OF GASES\\\\nFirst complete data on pressure-volume-\\\\ntemperature relations of a substance in both\\\\ngaseous and liquid state was obtained by\\\\nThomas Andrews on Carbon dioxide. He plotted\\\\nisotherms of carbon dioxide at various\\\\ntemperatures (Fig. 5.13). Later on it was found\\\\nthat real gases behave in the same manner as\\\\ncarbon dioxide. Andrews noticed that at high\\\\ntemperatures isotherms look like that of an\\\\nideal gas and the gas cannot be liquified even at\\\\nvery high pressure. As the temperature is\\\\nlowered, shape of the curve changes and data\\\\nshow considerable deviation from ideal\\\\nbehaviour. At 30.98°C carbon dioxide remains\\\\ngas upto 73 atmospheric pressure. (Point E in\\\\nFig. 5.13). At 73 atmospheric pressure, liquid\\\\ncarbon dioxide appears for the first time. The\\\\ntemperature 30.98°C is called critical\\\\ntemperature ( T C) of carbon dioxide. This is the\\\\nhighest temperature at which liquid carbon\\\\ndioxide is observed. Above this temperature it\\\\nis gas. Volume of one mole of the gas at critical\\\\ntemperature is called critical volume ( V C) and\\\\npressure at this temperature is called critical\\\\npressure ( p C). The critical temperature, pressure\\\\nand volume are called critical constants. Further\\\\nincrease in pressure simply compresses the\\\\nFig. 5.12 Variation of compressibility factor for\\\\nsome gases\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 153\\\\n\\\\nThus we see that a point like A in the Fig. 5.1 3\\\\nrepresents gaseous state. A point like D\\\\nrepresents liquid state and a point under the\\\\ndome shaped area represents existence of liquid\\\\nand gaseous carbon dioxide in equilibrium. All\\\\nthe gases upon compression at constant\\\\ntemperature (isothermal compression) show the\\\\nsame behaviour as shown by carbon dioxide.\\\\nAlso above discussion shows that gases should\\\\nbe cooled below their critical temperature for\\\\nliquification. Critical temperature of a gas is\\\\nhighest temperature at which liquifaction of the\\\\ngas first occurs. Liquifaction of so called\\\\npermanent gases (i.e., gases which show\\\\ncontinuous positive deviation in Z value)\\\\nrequires cooling as well as considerable\\\\ncompression. Compression brings the\\\\nmolecules in close vicinity and cooling slows\\\\ndown the movement of molecules therefore,\\\\nintermolecular interactions may hold the closely\\\\nand slowly moving molecules together and the\\\\ngas liquifies.\\\\nIt is possible to change a gas into liquid or\\\\na liquid into gas by a process in which always\\\\na single phase is present. For example in\\\\nFig. 5.13 we can move from point A to F\\\\nvertically by increasing the temperature, then\\\\nwe can reach the point G by compressing the\\\\ngas at the constant temperature along this\\\\nisotherm (isotherm at 31.1°C). The pressure\\\\nwill increase. Now we can move vertically down\\\\ntowards D by lowering the temperature. As\\\\nsoon as we cross the point H on the critical\\\\nisotherm we get liquid. We end up with liquid\\\\nbut in this series of changes we do not pass\\\\nthrough two-phase region. If process is carried\\\\nout at the critical temperature, substance\\\\nalways remains in one phase.\\\\nThus there is continuity between the\\\\ngaseous and liquid state. The term fluid is used\\\\nfor either a liquid or a gas to recognise this\\\\ncontinuity. Thus a liquid can be viewed as a\\\\nvery dense gas. Liquid and gas can be\\\\ndistinguished only when the fluid is below its\\\\ncritical temperature and its pressure and\\\\nvolume lie under the dome, since in that\\\\nsituation liquid and gas are in equilibrium and\\\\na surface separating the two phases is visible.\\\\nIn the absence of this surface there is no\\\\nliquid carbon dioxide and the curve represents\\\\nthe compressibility of the liquid. The steep line\\\\nrepresents the isotherm of liquid. Even a slight\\\\ncompression results in steep rise in pressure\\\\nindicating very low compressibility of the liquid.\\\\nBelow 30.98 °C, the behaviour of the gas on\\\\ncompression is quite different. At 21.5 °C,\\\\ncarbon dioxide remains as a gas only upto\\\\npoint B. At point B, liquid of a particular volume\\\\nappears. Further compression does not change\\\\nthe pressure. Liquid and gaseous carbon\\\\ndioxide coexist and further application of\\\\npressure results in the condensation of more\\\\ngas until the point C is reached. At point C, all\\\\nthe gas has been condensed and further\\\\napplication of pressure merely compresses the\\\\nliquid as shown by steep line. A slight\\\\ncompression from volume V 2 to V 3 results in\\\\nsteep rise in pressure from p 2 to p 3 (Fig. 5.13).\\\\nBelow 30.98 °C (critical temperature) each\\\\ncurve shows the similar trend. Only length of\\\\nthe horizontal line increases at lower\\\\ntemperatures. At critical point horizontal\\\\nportion of the isotherm merges into one point.\\\\nFig. 5.13Isotherms of carbon dioxide at various\\\\ntemperatures\\\\n\\\\n154 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nfundamental way of distinguishing between\\\\ntwo states. At critical temperature, liquid\\\\npasses into gaseous state imperceptibly and\\\\ncontinuously; the surface separating two\\\\nphases disappears (Section 5.11.1). A gas\\\\nbelow the critical temperature can be liquified\\\\nby applying pressure, and is called vapour of\\\\nthe substance. Carbon dioxide gas below its\\\\ncritical temperature is called carbon dioxide\\\\nvapour. Critical constants for some common\\\\nsubstances are given in Table 5.4.\\\\n\\\\nbetween them and under normal conditions\\\\nliquids are denser than gases.\\\\nMolecules of liquids are held together by\\\\nattractive intermolecular forces. Liquids have\\\\ndefinite volume because molecules do not\\\\nseparate from each other. However, molecules\\\\nof liquids can move past one another freely,\\\\ntherefore, liquids can flow, can be poured and\\\\ncan assume the shape of the container in which\\\\nthese are stored. In the following sections we\\\\nwill look into some of the physical properties\\\\nof the liquids such as vapour pressure, surface\\\\ntension and viscosity.\\\\n5.11.1 Vapour Pressure\\\\nIf an evacuated container is partially filled with\\\\na liquid, a portion of liquid evaporates to fill\\\\nthe remaining volume of the container with\\\\nvapour. Initially the liquid evaporates and\\\\npressure exerted by vapours on the walls of\\\\nthe container (vapour pressure) increases. After\\\\nsome time it becomes constant, an equilibrium\\\\nis established between liquid phase and\\\\nvapour phase. Vapour pressure at this stage\\\\nis known as equilibrium vapour pressure or\\\\nsaturated vapour pressure.. Since process of\\\\nvapourisation is temperature dependent; the\\\\ntemperature must be mentioned while\\\\nreporting the vapour pressure of a liquid.\\\\nWhen a liquid is heated in an open vessel,\\\\nthe liquid vapourises from the surface. At the\\\\ntemperature at which vapour pressure of the\\\\nliquid becomes equal to the external pressure,\\\\nvapourisation can occur throughout the bulk\\\\nof the liquid and vapours expand freely into\\\\nthe surroundings. The condition of free\\\\nvapourisation throughout the liquid is called\\\\nboiling. The temperature at which vapour\\\\npressure of liquid is equal to the external\\\\npressure is called boiling temperature at that\\\\npressure. Vapour pressure of some common\\\\nliquids at various temperatures is given in\\\\n(Fig. 5.14, page 155). At 1 atm pressure boiling\\\\ntemperature is called normal boiling point.\\\\nIf pressure is 1 bar then the boiling point is\\\\ncalled standard boiling point of the liquid.\\\\nStandard boiling point of the liquid is slightly\\\\nlower than the normal boiling point because\\\\nTable 5.4 Critical Constants for Some\\\\nSubstances\\\\nProblem 5.5\\\\nGases possess characteristic critical\\\\ntemperature which depends upon the\\\\nmagnitude of intermolecular forces\\\\nbetween the gas particles. Critical\\\\ntemperatures of ammonia and carbon\\\\ndioxide are 405.5 K and 304.10 K\\\\nrespectively. Which of these gases will\\\\nliquify first when you start cooling from\\\\n500 K to their critical temperature?\\\\nSolution\\\\nAmmonia will liquify first because its\\\\ncritical temperature will be reached first.\\\\nLiquifaction of CO 2 will require more\\\\ncooling.\\\\n\\\\n5.11Liquid State\\\\n\\\\nIntermolecular forces are stronger in liquid\\\\nstate than in gaseous state. Molecules in liquids\\\\nare so close that there is very little empty space\\\\n\\\\nSTATES OF MATTER 155\\\\n\\\\n1 bar pressure is slightly less than 1 atm\\\\npressure. The normal boiling point of water is\\\\n100 °C (373 K), its standard boiling point is\\\\n99.6 °C (372.6 K).\\\\nAt high altitudes atmospheric pressure is\\\\nlow. Therefore liquids at high altitudes boil at\\\\nlower temperatures in comparison to that at\\\\nsea level. Since water boils at low temperature\\\\non hills, the pressure cooker is used for\\\\ncooking food. In hospitals surgical instruments\\\\nare sterilized in autoclaves in which boiling\\\\npoint of water is increased by increasing the\\\\npressure above the atmospheric pressure by\\\\nusing a weight covering the vent.\\\\nBoiling does not occur when liquid is\\\\nheated in a closed vessel. On heating\\\\ncontinuously vapour pressure increases. At\\\\nfirst a clear boundary is visible between liquid\\\\nand vapour phase because liquid is more dense\\\\nthan vapour. As the temperature increases\\\\nmore and more molecules go to vapour phase\\\\nand density of vapours rises. At the same time\\\\nliquid becomes less dense. It expands because\\\\nmolecules move apart. When density of liquid\\\\nand vapours becomes the same; the clear\\\\nboundary between liquid and vapours\\\\ndisappears. This temperature is called critical\\\\ntemperature about which we have already\\\\ndiscussed in section 5.10.\\\\n5.11.2 Surface Tension\\\\nIt is well known fact that liquids assume the\\\\nshape of the container. Why is it then small\\\\ndrops of mercury form spherical bead instead\\\\nof spreading on the surface. Why do particles\\\\nof soil at the bottom of river remain separated\\\\nbut they stick together when taken out? Why\\\\ndoes a liquid rise (or fall) in a thin capillary as\\\\nsoon as the capillary touches the surface of\\\\nthe liquid? All these phenomena are caused\\\\ndue to the characteristic property of liquids,\\\\ncalled surface tension. A molecule in the bulk\\\\nof liquid experiences equal intermolecular\\\\nforces from all sides. The molecule, therefore\\\\ndoes not experience any net force. But for the\\\\nmolecule on the surface of liquid, net attractive\\\\nforce is towards the interior of the liquid (Fig.\\\\n5.15), due to the molecules below it. Since there\\\\nare no molecules above it.\\\\nLiquids tend to minimize their surface area.\\\\nThe molecules on the surface experience a net\\\\ndownward force and have more energy than\\\\nFig. 5.14Vapour pressure vs temperature curve\\\\nof some common liquids.\\\\nFig. 5.1 5 Forces acting on a molecule on liquid\\\\nsurface and on a molecule inside the\\\\nliquid\\\\n\\\\n156 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nthe molecules in the bulk, which do not\\\\nexperience any net force. Therefore, liquids tend\\\\nto have minimum number of molecules at their\\\\nsurface. If surface of the liquid is increased by\\\\npulling a molecule from the bulk, attractive\\\\nforces will have to be overcome. This will\\\\nrequire expenditure of energy. The energy\\\\nrequired to increase the surface area of the\\\\nliquid by one unit is defined as surface energy.\\\\nIts dimensions are J m–2. Surface tension is\\\\ndefined as the force acting per unit length\\\\nperpendicular to the line drawn on the surface\\\\nof liquid. It is denoted by Greek letter γ\\\\n(Gamma). It has dimensions of kg s–2 and in SI\\\\nunit it is expressed as N m–1.^ The lowest energy\\\\nstate of the liquid will be when surface area is\\\\nminimum. Spherical shape satisfies this\\\\ncondition, that is why mercury drops are\\\\nspherical in shape. This is the reason that sharp\\\\nglass edges are heated for making them\\\\nsmooth. On heating, the glass melts and the\\\\nsurface of the liquid tends to take the rounded\\\\nshape at the edges, which makes the edges\\\\nsmooth. This is called fire polishing of glass.\\\\n\\\\nLiquid tends to rise (or fall) in the capillary\\\\nbecause of surface tension. Liquids wet the\\\\nthings because they spread across their surfaces\\\\nas thin film. Moist soil grains are pulled together\\\\nbecause surface area of thin film of water is\\\\nreduced. It is surface tension which gives\\\\nstretching property to the surface of a liquid.\\\\nOn flat surface, droplets are slightly flattened\\\\nby the effect of gravity; but in the gravity free\\\\nenvironments drops are perfectly spherical.\\\\n\\\\nThe magnitude of surface tension of a liquid\\\\ndepends on the attractive forces between the\\\\nmolecules. When the attractive forces are large,\\\\nthe surface tension is large. Increase in\\\\ntemperature increases the kinetic energy of the\\\\nmolecules and effectiveness of intermolecular\\\\nattraction decreases, so surface tension\\\\ndecreases as the temperature is raised.\\\\n\\\\n5.11.3 Viscosity\\\\n\\\\nIt is one of the characteristic properties of\\\\nliquids. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to\\\\nflow which arises due to the internal friction\\\\n\\\\nF ∝A\\\\n\\\\ndu\\\\ndz\\\\n. (where,\\\\n\\\\ndu\\\\ndz\\\\nis velocity gradient;\\\\nthe change in velocity with distance)\\\\n\\\\nF ∝A\\\\n\\\\ndu\\\\ndz\\\\n\\\\n⇒ F =ηA\\\\ndu\\\\ndz\\\\n\\\\n’ is\\\\nmeasure of viscosity. SI unit of viscosity\\\\ncoefficient is 1 newton second per square metre\\\\n(N s m–2) = pascal second (Pa s = 1kg m–1s–1). In\\\\ncgs system the unit of coefficient of viscosity is\\\\npoise (named after great scientist Jean Louise\\\\nPoiseuille).\\\\n1 poise = 1 g cm–1s–1 = 10–1kg m–1s–1\\\\nGreater the viscosity, the more slowly the\\\\nliquid flows. Hydrogen bonding and van der\\\\nWaals forces are strong enough to cause high\\\\nviscosity. Glass is an extremely viscous liquid.\\\\nIt is so viscous that many of its properties\\\\nresemble solids.\\\\nViscosity of liquids decreases as the\\\\ntemperature rises because at high temperature\\\\nmolecules have high kinetic energy and can\\\\novercome the intermolecular forces to slip past\\\\none another between the layers.\\\\n\\\\n158 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n5.1 What will be the minimum pressure required to compress 500 dm^3 of air at 1 bar to\\\\n200 dm^3 at 30°C?\\\\n5.2 A vessel of 120 mL capacity contains a certain amount of gas at 35 °C and 1.2 bar\\\\npressure.

The chemical energy may also be\\\\nused to do mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine\\\\nor to provide electrical energy through a galvanic cell like\\\\ndry cell. Thus, various forms of energy are interrelated and\\\\nunder certain conditions, these may be transformed from\\\\none form into another. The study of these energy\\\\ntransformations forms the subject matter of thermodynamics.\\\\nThe laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes of\\\\nmacroscopic systems involving a large number of molecules\\\\nrather than microscopic systems containing a few molecules.\\\\nThermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what\\\\nrate these energy transformations are carried out, but is\\\\nbased on initial and final states of a system undergoing the\\\\nchange. Laws of thermodynamics apply only when a system\\\\nis in equilibrium or moves from one equilibrium state to\\\\nanother equilibrium state. Macroscopic properties like\\\\npressure and temperature do not change with time for a\\\\nsystem in equilibrium state. In this unit, we would like to\\\\nanswer some of the important questions through\\\\nthermodynamics, like:\\\\nHow do we determine the energy changes involved in a\\\\nchemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?\\\\nWhat drives a chemical reaction/process?\\\\nTo what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?\\\\nUNIT 6\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 161\\\\n\\\\n6.1 Thermodynamic Terms\\\\n\\\\nWe are interested in chemical reactions and the\\\\nenergy changes accompanying them. For this\\\\nwe need to know certain thermodynamic\\\\nterms. These are discussed below.\\\\n6.1.1 The System and the Surroundings\\\\nA system in thermodynamics refers to that\\\\npart of universe in which observations are\\\\nmade and remaining universe constitutes the\\\\nsurroundings. The surroundings include\\\\neverything other than the system. System and\\\\nthe surroundings together constitute the\\\\nuniverse.\\\\nThe universe = The system + The surroundings\\\\nHowever, the entire universe other than\\\\nthe system is not affected by the changes\\\\ntaking place in the system. Therefore, for\\\\nall practical purposes, the surroundings\\\\nare that portion of the remaining universe\\\\nwhich can interact with the system.\\\\nUsually, the region of space in the\\\\nneighbourhood of the system constitutes\\\\nits surroundings.\\\\nFor example, if we are studying the\\\\nreaction between two substances A and B\\\\nkept in a beaker, the beaker containing the\\\\nreaction mixture is the system and the room\\\\nwhere the beaker is kept is the surroundings\\\\n(Fig. 6.1).\\\\nbe real or imaginary. The wall that separates\\\\nthe system from the surroundings is called\\\\nboundary. This is designed to allow us to\\\\ncontrol and keep track of all movements of\\\\nmatter and energy in or out of the system.\\\\n6.1.2 Types of the System\\\\nWe, further classify the systems according to\\\\nthe movements of matter and energy in or out\\\\nof the system.\\\\n1. Open System\\\\nIn an open system, there is exchange of energy\\\\nand matter between system and surroundings\\\\n[Fig. 6.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an\\\\nopen beaker is an example of an open system*.\\\\nHere the boundary is an imaginary surface\\\\nenclosing the beaker and reactants.\\\\n2. Closed System\\\\nIn a closed system, there is no exchange of\\\\nmatter, but exchange of energy is possible\\\\nbetween system and the surroundings\\\\n[Fig. 6.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a\\\\nclosed vessel made of conducting material e.g.,\\\\ncopper or steel is an example of a closed\\\\nsystem.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.2 Open, closed and isolated systems.\\\\nFig. 6.1 System and the surroundings\\\\nNote that the system may be defined by\\\\nphysical boundaries, like beaker or test tube,\\\\nor the system may simply be defined by a set\\\\nof Cartesian coordinates specifying a\\\\nparticular volume in space. It is necessary to\\\\nthink of the system as separated from the\\\\nsurroundings by some sort of wall which may\\\\n\\\\nWe could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.\\\\n\\\\n162 CHEMISTRY\\\\n3. Isolated System\\\\nIn an isolated system, there is no exchange of\\\\nenergy or matter between the system and the\\\\nsurroundings [Fig. 6.2 (c)]. The presence of\\\\nreactants in a thermos flask or any other closed\\\\ninsulated vessel is an example of an isolated\\\\nsystem.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.3 The State of the System\\\\n\\\\nThe system must be described in order to make\\\\nany useful calculations by specifying\\\\nquantitatively each of the properties such as\\\\nits pressure ( p ), volume ( V ), and temperature\\\\n( T ) as well as the composition of the system.\\\\nWe need to describe the system by specifying\\\\nit before and after the change. You would recall\\\\nfrom your Physics course that the state of a\\\\nsystem in mechanics is completely specified at\\\\na given instant of time, by the position and\\\\nvelocity of each mass point of the system. In\\\\nthermodynamics, a different and much simpler\\\\nconcept of the state of a system is introduced.\\\\nIt does not need detailed knowledge of motion\\\\nof each particle because, we deal with average\\\\nmeasurable properties of the system. We specify\\\\nthe state of the system by state functions or\\\\nstate variables.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State\\\\nFunction\\\\n\\\\nWhen we talk about our chemical system\\\\nlosing or gaining energy, we need to introduce\\\\na quantity which represents the total energy\\\\n\\\\nof the system. It may be chemical, electrical,\\\\nmechanical or any other type of energy you\\\\nmay think of, the sum of all these is the energy\\\\nof the system. In thermodynamics, we call it\\\\nthe internal energy, U of the system, which may\\\\nchange, when\\\\n- •••• heat passes into or out of the system,\\\\n- •••• work is done on or by the system,\\\\n    ••••• matter enters or leaves the system.\\\\n       These systems are classified accordingly as\\\\n    you have already studied in section 6.1.2.\\\\n\\\\n(a) Work\\\\nLet us first examine a change in internal\\\\nenergy by doing work. We take a system\\\\ncontaining some quantity of water in a thermos\\\\nflask or in an insulated beaker. This would not\\\\nallow exchange of heat between the system\\\\nand surroundings through its boundary and\\\\nwe call this type of system as adiabatic. The\\\\nmanner in which the state of such a system\\\\nmay be changed will be called adiabatic\\\\nprocess. Adiabatic process is a process in\\\\nwhich there is no transfer of heat between the\\\\nsystem and surroundings. Here, the wall\\\\nseparating the system and the surroundings\\\\nis called the adiabatic wall (Fig 6.3).\\\\nLet us bring the change in the internal\\\\nenergy of the system by doing some work on\\\\nFig. 6.3 An adiabatic system which does not\\\\npermit the transfer of heat through its\\\\nboundary.\\\\nit. Let us call the initial state of the system as\\\\nstate A and its temperature as T A. Let the\\\\ninternal energy of the system in state A be\\\\ncalled U A. We can change the state of the system\\\\nin two different ways.\\\\n\\\\nSecond way: We now do an equal amount (i.e.,\\\\n1kJ) electrical work with the help of an\\\\nimmersion rod and note down the temperature\\\\nchange. We find that the change in temperature\\\\nis same as in the earlier case, say, T B – T A.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, the experiments in the above\\\\nmanner were done by J. P. Joule between\\\\n1840–50 and he was able to show that a given\\\\namount of work done on the system, no matter\\\\nhow it was done (irrespective of path) produced\\\\nthe same change of state, as measured by the\\\\nchange in the temperature of the system.\\\\n\\\\nSo, it seems appropriate to define a\\\\nquantity, the internal energy U , whose value\\\\nis characteristic of the state of a system,\\\\nwhereby the adiabatic work, wad required to\\\\nbring about a change of state is equal to the\\\\ndifference between the value of U in one state\\\\nand that in another state, ∆ U i.e.,\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = U 2 − U 1 = wad\\\\nTherefore, internal energy, U , of the system\\\\nis a state function.\\\\n\\\\nBy conventions of IUPAC in chemical\\\\nthermodynamics. The positive sign expresses\\\\nthat wad is positive when work is done on the\\\\nsystem and the internal energy of system\\\\nincreases. Similarly, if the work is done by the\\\\nsystem,wad will be negative because internal\\\\nenergy of the system decreases.\\\\n\\\\nCan you name some other familiar state\\\\nfunctions? Some of other familiar state\\\\nfunctions are V , p , and T. For example, if we\\\\nbring a change in temperature of the system\\\\nfrom 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature\\\\nis 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight\\\\nup to 35°C or we cool the system for a few\\\\ndegrees, then take the system to the final\\\\ntemperature. Thus, T is a state function and\\\\nthe change in temperature is independent of\\\\n\\\\nthe route taken. Volume of water in a pond,\\\\nfor example, is a state function, because\\\\nchange in volume of its water is independent\\\\nof the route by which water is filled in the\\\\npond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both.\\\\n(b) Heat\\\\nWe can also change the internal energy of a\\\\nsystem by transfer of heat from the\\\\nsurroundings to the system or vice-versa\\\\nwithout expenditure of work. This exchange\\\\nof energy, which is a result of temperature\\\\ndifference is called heat, q. Let us consider\\\\nbringing about the same change in temperature\\\\n(the same initial and final states as before in\\\\nsection 6.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat through\\\\nthermally conducting walls instead of\\\\nadiabatic walls (Fig. 6.4).\\\\nWe take water at temperature, T A in a\\\\ncontainer having thermally conducting walls,\\\\nsay made up of copper and enclose it in a huge\\\\nheat reservoir at temperature, T B. The heat\\\\nabsorbed by the system (water), q can be\\\\nmeasured in terms of temperature difference ,\\\\nT B – T A. In this case change in internal energy,\\\\n∆ U = q , when no work is done at constant\\\\nvolume.\\\\nBy conventions of IUPAC in chemical\\\\nthermodynamics. The q is positive, when\\\\nheat is transferred from the surroundings to\\\\nthe system and the internal energy of the\\\\nsystem increases and q is negative when\\\\nheat is transferred from system to the\\\\nsurroundings resulting in decrease of the\\\\ninternal energy of the system..\\\\n* Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the\\\\nsystem. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign', 'some common liquids.\\\\nFig. 5.1 5 Forces acting on a molecule on liquid\\\\nsurface and on a molecule inside the\\\\nliquid\\\\n\\\\n156 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nthe molecules in the bulk, which do not\\\\nexperience any net force. Therefore, liquids tend\\\\nto have minimum number of molecules at their\\\\nsurface. If surface of the liquid is increased by\\\\npulling a molecule from the bulk, attractive\\\\nforces will have to be overcome. This will\\\\nrequire expenditure of energy. The energy\\\\nrequired to increase the surface area of the\\\\nliquid by one unit is defined as surface energy.\\\\nIts dimensions are J m–2. Surface tension is\\\\ndefined as the force acting per unit length\\\\nperpendicular to the line drawn on the surface\\\\nof liquid. It is denoted by Greek letter γ\\\\n(Gamma). It has dimensions of kg s–2 and in SI\\\\nunit it is expressed as N m–1.^ The lowest energy\\\\nstate of the liquid will be when surface area is\\\\nminimum. Spherical shape satisfies this\\\\ncondition, that is why mercury drops are\\\\nspherical in shape. This is the reason that sharp\\\\nglass edges are heated for making them\\\\nsmooth. On heating, the glass melts and the\\\\nsurface of the liquid tends to take the rounded\\\\nshape at the edges, which makes the edges\\\\nsmooth. This is called fire polishing of glass.\\\\n\\\\nLiquid tends to rise (or fall) in the capillary\\\\nbecause of surface tension. Liquids wet the\\\\nthings because they spread across their surfaces\\\\nas thin film. Moist soil grains are pulled together\\\\nbecause surface area of thin film of water is\\\\nreduced. It is surface tension which gives\\\\nstretching property to the surface of a liquid.\\\\nOn flat surface, droplets are slightly flattened\\\\nby the effect of gravity; but in the gravity free\\\\nenvironments drops are perfectly spherical.\\\\n\\\\nThe magnitude of surface tension of a liquid\\\\ndepends on the attractive forces between the\\\\nmolecules. When the attractive forces are large,\\\\nthe surface tension is large. Increase in\\\\ntemperature increases the kinetic energy of the\\\\nmolecules and effectiveness of intermolecular\\\\nattraction decreases, so surface tension\\\\ndecreases as the temperature is raised.\\\\n\\\\n5.11.3 Viscosity\\\\n\\\\nIt is one of the characteristic properties of\\\\nliquids. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to\\\\nflow which arises due to the internal friction\\\\n\\\\nF ∝A\\\\n\\\\ndu\\\\ndz\\\\n.

Glass is an extremely viscous liquid.\\\\nIt is so viscous that many of its properties\\\\nresemble solids.\\\\nViscosity of liquids decreases as the\\\\ntemperature rises because at high temperature\\\\nmolecules have high kinetic energy and can\\\\novercome the intermolecular forces to slip past\\\\none another between the layers.\\\\n\\\\n158 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n5.1 What will be the minimum pressure required to compress 500 dm^3 of air at 1 bar to\\\\n200 dm^3 at 30°C?\\\\n5.2 A vessel of 120 mL capacity contains a certain amount of gas at 35 °C and 1.2 bar\\\\npressure.

The chemical energy may also be\\\\nused to do mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine\\\\nor to provide electrical energy through a galvanic cell like\\\\ndry cell. Thus, various forms of energy are interrelated and\\\\nunder certain conditions, these may be transformed from\\\\none form into another. The study of these energy\\\\ntransformations forms the subject matter of thermodynamics.\\\\nThe laws of thermodynamics deal with energy changes of\\\\nmacroscopic systems involving a large number of molecules\\\\nrather than microscopic systems containing a few molecules.\\\\nThermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what\\\\nrate these energy transformations are carried out, but is\\\\nbased on initial and final states of a system undergoing the\\\\nchange. Laws of thermodynamics apply only when a system\\\\nis in equilibrium or moves from one equilibrium state to\\\\nanother equilibrium state. Macroscopic properties like\\\\npressure and temperature do not change with time for a\\\\nsystem in equilibrium state. In this unit, we would like to\\\\nanswer some of the important questions through\\\\nthermodynamics, like:\\\\nHow do we determine the energy changes involved in a\\\\nchemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?\\\\nWhat drives a chemical reaction/process?\\\\nTo what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?\\\\nUNIT 6\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 161\\\\n\\\\n6.1 Thermodynamic Terms\\\\n\\\\nWe are interested in chemical reactions and the\\\\nenergy changes accompanying them. For this\\\\nwe need to know certain thermodynamic\\\\nterms. These are discussed below.\\\\n6.1.1 The System and the Surroundings\\\\nA system in thermodynamics refers to that\\\\npart of universe in which observations are\\\\nmade and remaining universe constitutes the\\\\nsurroundings. The surroundings include\\\\neverything other than the system. System and\\\\nthe surroundings together constitute the\\\\nuniverse.\\\\nThe universe = The system + The surroundings\\\\nHowever, the entire universe other than\\\\nthe system is not affected by the changes\\\\ntaking place in the system. Therefore, for\\\\nall practical purposes, the surroundings\\\\nare that portion of the remaining universe\\\\nwhich can interact with the system.\\\\nUsually, the region of space in the\\\\nneighbourhood of the system constitutes\\\\nits surroundings.\\\\nFor example, if we are studying the\\\\nreaction between two substances A and B\\\\nkept in a beaker, the beaker containing the\\\\nreaction mixture is the system and the room\\\\nwhere the beaker is kept is the surroundings\\\\n(Fig. 6.1).\\\\nbe real or imaginary. The wall that separates\\\\nthe system from the surroundings is called\\\\nboundary. This is designed to allow us to\\\\ncontrol and keep track of all movements of\\\\nmatter and energy in or out of the system.\\\\n6.1.2 Types of the System\\\\nWe, further classify the systems according to\\\\nthe movements of matter and energy in or out\\\\nof the system.\\\\n1. Open System\\\\nIn an open system, there is exchange of energy\\\\nand matter between system and surroundings\\\\n[Fig. 6.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an\\\\nopen beaker is an example of an open system*.\\\\nHere the boundary is an imaginary surface\\\\nenclosing the beaker and reactants.\\\\n2. Closed System\\\\nIn a closed system, there is no exchange of\\\\nmatter, but exchange of energy is possible\\\\nbetween system and the surroundings\\\\n[Fig. 6.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a\\\\nclosed vessel made of conducting material e.g.,\\\\ncopper or steel is an example of a closed\\\\nsystem.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.2 Open, closed and isolated systems.\\\\nFig. 6.1 System and the surroundings\\\\nNote that the system may be defined by\\\\nphysical boundaries, like beaker or test tube,\\\\nor the system may simply be defined by a set\\\\nof Cartesian coordinates specifying a\\\\nparticular volume in space. It is necessary to\\\\nthink of the system as separated from the\\\\nsurroundings by some sort of wall which may\\\\n\\\\nWe could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.\\\\n\\\\n162 CHEMISTRY\\\\n3. Isolated System\\\\nIn an isolated system, there is no exchange of\\\\nenergy or matter between the system and the\\\\nsurroundings [Fig. 6.2 (c)]. The presence of\\\\nreactants in a thermos flask or any other closed\\\\ninsulated vessel is an example of an isolated\\\\nsystem.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.3 The State of the System\\\\n\\\\nThe system must be described in order to make\\\\nany useful calculations by specifying\\\\nquantitatively each of the properties such as\\\\nits pressure ( p ), volume ( V ), and temperature\\\\n( T ) as well as the composition of the system.\\\\nWe need to describe the system by specifying\\\\nit before and after the change. You would recall\\\\nfrom your Physics course that the state of a\\\\nsystem in mechanics is completely specified at\\\\na given instant of time, by the position and\\\\nvelocity of each mass point of the system. In\\\\nthermodynamics, a different and much simpler\\\\nconcept of the state of a system is introduced.\\\\nIt does not need detailed knowledge of motion\\\\nof each particle because, we deal with average\\\\nmeasurable properties of the system. We specify\\\\nthe state of the system by state functions or\\\\nstate variables.\\\\n\\\\n6.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State\\\\nFunction\\\\n\\\\nWhen we talk about our chemical system\\\\nlosing or gaining energy, we need to introduce\\\\na quantity which represents the total energy\\\\n\\\\nof the system. It may be chemical, electrical,\\\\nmechanical or any other type of energy you\\\\nmay think of, the sum of all these is the energy\\\\nof the system. In thermodynamics, we call it\\\\nthe internal energy, U of the system, which may\\\\nchange, when\\\\n- •••• heat passes into or out of the system,\\\\n- •••• work is done on or by the system,\\\\n    ••••• matter enters or leaves the system.\\\\n       These systems are classified accordingly as\\\\n    you have already studied in section 6.1.2.\\\\n\\\\n(a) Work\\\\nLet us first examine a change in internal\\\\nenergy by doing work. We take a system\\\\ncontaining some quantity of water in a thermos\\\\nflask or in an insulated beaker. This would not\\\\nallow exchange of heat between the system\\\\nand surroundings through its boundary and\\\\nwe call this type of system as adiabatic. The\\\\nmanner in which the state of such a system\\\\nmay be changed will be called adiabatic\\\\nprocess. Adiabatic process is a process in\\\\nwhich there is no transfer of heat between the\\\\nsystem and surroundings. Here, the wall\\\\nseparating the system and the surroundings\\\\nis called the adiabatic wall (Fig 6.3).\\\\nLet us bring the change in the internal\\\\nenergy of the system by doing some work on\\\\nFig. 6.3 An adiabatic system which does not\\\\npermit the transfer of heat through its\\\\nboundary.\\\\nit. Let us call the initial state of the system as\\\\nstate A and its temperature as T A. Let the\\\\ninternal energy of the system in state A be\\\\ncalled U A. We can change the state of the system\\\\nin two different ways.\\\\n\\\\nSecond way: We now do an equal amount (i.e.,\\\\n1kJ) electrical work with the help of an\\\\nimmersion rod and note down the temperature\\\\nchange. We find that the change in temperature\\\\nis same as in the earlier case, say, T B – T A.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, the experiments in the above\\\\nmanner were done by J. P. Joule between\\\\n1840–50 and he was able to show that a given\\\\namount of work done on the system, no matter\\\\nhow it was done (irrespective of path) produced\\\\nthe same change of state, as measured by the\\\\nchange in the temperature of the system.\\\\n\\\\nSo, it seems appropriate to define a\\\\nquantity, the internal energy U , whose value\\\\nis characteristic of the state of a system,\\\\nwhereby the adiabatic work, wad required to\\\\nbring about a change of state is equal to the\\\\ndifference between the value of U in one state\\\\nand that in another state, ∆ U i.e.,\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = U 2 − U 1 = wad\\\\nTherefore, internal energy, U , of the system\\\\nis a state function.\\\\n\\\\nBy conventions of IUPAC in chemical\\\\nthermodynamics. The positive sign expresses\\\\nthat wad is positive when work is done on the\\\\nsystem and the internal energy of system\\\\nincreases. Similarly, if the work is done by the\\\\nsystem,wad will be negative because internal\\\\nenergy of the system decreases.\\\\n\\\\nCan you name some other familiar state\\\\nfunctions? Some of other familiar state\\\\nfunctions are V , p , and T. For example, if we\\\\nbring a change in temperature of the system\\\\nfrom 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature\\\\nis 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight\\\\nup to 35°C or we cool the system for a few\\\\ndegrees, then take the system to the final\\\\ntemperature. Thus, T is a state function and\\\\nthe change in temperature is independent of\\\\n\\\\nthe route taken. Volume of water in a pond,\\\\nfor example, is a state function, because\\\\nchange in volume of its water is independent\\\\nof the route by which water is filled in the\\\\npond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both.\\\\n(b) Heat\\\\nWe can also change the internal energy of a\\\\nsystem by transfer of heat from the\\\\nsurroundings to the system or vice-versa\\\\nwithout expenditure of work. This exchange\\\\nof energy, which is a result of temperature\\\\ndifference is called heat, q. Let us consider\\\\nbringing about the same change in temperature\\\\n(the same initial and final states as before in\\\\nsection 6.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat through\\\\nthermally conducting walls instead of\\\\nadiabatic walls (Fig. 6.4).\\\\nWe take water at temperature, T A in a\\\\ncontainer having thermally conducting walls,\\\\nsay made up of copper and enclose it in a huge\\\\nheat reservoir at temperature, T B. The heat\\\\nabsorbed by the system (water), q can be\\\\nmeasured in terms of temperature difference ,\\\\nT B – T A. In this case change in internal energy,\\\\n∆ U = q , when no work is done at constant\\\\nvolume.\\\\nBy conventions of IUPAC in chemical\\\\nthermodynamics. The q is positive, when\\\\nheat is transferred from the surroundings to\\\\nthe system and the internal energy of the\\\\nsystem increases and q is negative when\\\\nheat is transferred from system to the\\\\nsurroundings resulting in decrease of the\\\\ninternal energy of the system..\\\\n* Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the\\\\nsystem. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.4 A system which allows heat transfer\\\\nthrough its boundary.\\\\n\\\\n164 CHEMISTRY\\\\n(c) The general case\\\\n\\\\nLet us consider the general case in which a\\\\nchange of state is brought about both by\\\\ndoing work and by transfer of heat. We write\\\\nchange in internal energy for this case as:\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = q + w (6.1)\\\\n\\\\nFor a given change in state, q and w can\\\\nvary depending on how the change is carried\\\\nout. However, q +w = ∆ U will depend only on\\\\ninitial and final state. It will be independent of\\\\nthe way the change is carried out. If there is\\\\nno transfer of energy as heat or as work\\\\n(isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then\\\\n∆ U = 0.\\\\n\\\\nThe equation 6.1 i.e., ∆ U = q + w is\\\\nmathematical statement of the first law of\\\\nthermodynamics, which states that\\\\n\\\\nThe energy of an isolated system is\\\\nconstant.\\\\nIt is commonly stated as the law of\\\\nconservation of energy i.e., energy can neither\\\\nbe created nor be destroyed.\\\\n\\\\nNote: There is considerable difference between\\\\nthe character of the thermodynamic property\\\\nenergy and that of a mechanical property such\\\\nas volume. We can specify an unambiguous\\\\n(absolute) value for volume of a system in a\\\\nparticular state, but not the absolute value of\\\\nthe internal energy. However, we can measure\\\\nonly the changes in the internal energy, ∆ U of\\\\nthe system.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 6.1\\\\nExpress the change in internal energy of\\\\na system when\\\\n(i) No heat is absorbed by the system\\\\nfrom the surroundings, but work (w)\\\\nis done on the system. What type of\\\\nwall does the system have?\\\\n(ii) No work is done on the system, but\\\\nq amount of heat is taken out from\\\\nthe system and given to the\\\\nsurroundings. What type of wall does\\\\nthe system have?\\\\n(iii) w amount of work is done by the\\\\nsystem and q amount of heat is\\\\nsupplied to the system. What type of\\\\nsystem would it be?\\\\nSolution\\\\n(i)∆ U = w ad, wall is adiabatic\\\\n(ii) ∆ U = – q , thermally conducting walls\\\\n(iii) ∆ U = q – w, closed system.\\\\n\\\\n6.2 Applications\\\\n\\\\nMany chemical reactions involve the generation\\\\nof gases capable of doing mechanical work or\\\\nthe generation of heat. It is important for us to\\\\nquantify these changes and relate them to the\\\\nchanges in the internal energy. Let us see how!\\\\n6.2.1 Work\\\\nFirst of all, let us concentrate on the nature of\\\\nwork a system can do. We will consider only\\\\nmechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.\\\\nFor understanding pressure-volume\\\\nwork, let us consider a cylinder which\\\\ncontains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with a\\\\nfrictionless piston. Total volume of the gas is\\\\nVi and pressure of the gas inside is p. If\\\\nexternal pressure is p ex which is greater than\\\\np , piston is moved inward till the pressure\\\\ninside becomes equal to p ex. Let this change\\\\nFig. 6.5(a) Work done on an ideal gas in a\\\\ncylinder when it is compressed by a\\\\nconstant external pressure, pex\\\\n(in single step) is equal to the shaded\\\\narea.\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 165\\\\nbe achieved in a single step and the final\\\\nvolume be Vf. During this compression,\\\\nsuppose piston moves a distance, l and is\\\\ncross-sectional area of the piston is A\\\\n[Fig. 6.5(a)].\\\\n\\\\nthen, volume change = l × A = ∆ V = ( Vf – Vi )\\\\n\\\\nWe also know,\\\\n\\\\nforce\\\\npressure\\\\narea\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, force on the piston = p ex. A\\\\nIf w is the work done on the system by\\\\nmovement of the piston then\\\\n\\\\nw = force × distance = pex. A. l\\\\n\\\\nThe negative sign of this expression is\\\\nrequired to obtain conventional sign for w,\\\\nwhich will be positive. It indicates that in case\\\\nof compression work is done on the system.\\\\nHere ( Vf – Vi ) will be negative and negative\\\\nmultiplied by negative will be positive. Hence\\\\nthe sign obtained for the work will be positive.\\\\nIf the pressure is not constant at every\\\\nstage of compression, but changes in number\\\\nof finite steps, work done on the gas will be\\\\nsummed over all the steps and will be equal\\\\n\\\\nto −∑ p V ∆ [Fig. 6.5 (b)]\\\\n\\\\n166 CHEMISTRY\\\\nother than reversible processes are known\\\\nas irreversible processes.\\\\n\\\\nIn chemistry, we face problems that can\\\\nbe solved if we relate the work term to the\\\\ninternal pressure of the system. We can\\\\nrelate work to internal pressure of the system\\\\nunder reversible conditions by writing\\\\nequation 6.3 as follows:\\\\n\\\\nw rev\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\n⇒ p =\\\\n\\\\nn R\\\\nTherefore, at constant temperature (isothermal\\\\nprocess),\\\\n\\\\nwrev= −∫ n R T = − n R\\\\n\\\\ndV\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\nf\\\\ni\\\\n\\\\n(6.5)\\\\n\\\\nFree expansion: Expansion of a gas in\\\\nvacuum ( pex = 0) is called free expansion. No\\\\nwork is done during free expansion of an ideal\\\\ngas whether the process is reversible or\\\\nirreversible (equation 6.2 and 6.3).\\\\n\\\\nNow, we can write equation 6.1 in number\\\\nof ways depending on the type of processes.\\\\n\\\\nLet us substitute w = – pex ∆ V (eq. 6.2) in\\\\nequation 6.1, and we get\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = q p − ex ∆ V\\\\nIf a process is carried out at constant volume\\\\n(∆ V = 0), then\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = qV\\\\nthe subscript V in qV^ denotes that heat is\\\\nsupplied at constant volume.\\\\n\\\\nIsothermal and free expansion of an\\\\nideal gas\\\\nFor isothermal ( T = constant) expansion of an\\\\nideal gas into vacuum ; w = 0 since pex = 0.\\\\nAlso, Joule determined experimentally that\\\\nq = 0; therefore, ∆ U = 0\\\\nEquation 6.1, ∆ U = q +w can be\\\\nexpressed for isothermal irreversible and\\\\nreversible changes as follows:\\\\n1. For isothermal irreversible change\\\\n    q = – w = pex ( Vf – Vi )\\\\n2. For isothermal reversible change\\\\n\\\\nq = – w = n R T ln\\\\nf\\\\ni\\\\nV\\\\nV\\\\n= 2.303 n R T log\\\\n\\\\nf\\\\ni\\\\n3. For adiabatic change, q = 0,\\\\n    ∆ U = wad\\\\n\\\\nProblem 6.2\\\\nTwo litres of an ideal gas at a pressure of\\\\n10 atm expands isothermally at 25 °C into\\\\na vacuum until its total volume is 10 litres.\\\\nHow much heat is absorbed and how much\\\\nwork is done in the expansion?\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe have q = – w = pex (10 – 2) = 0(8) = 0\\\\nNo work is done; no heat is absorbed.\\\\nProblem 6.3\\\\nConsider the same expansion, but this\\\\ntime against a constant external pressure\\\\nof 1 atm.\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe have q = – w = pex (8) = 8 litre-atm\\\\nProblem 6.4\\\\nConsider the expansion given in problem\\\\n6.2, for 1 mol of an ideal gas conducted\\\\nreversibly.\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe have q = – w = 2.303 nRT log\\\\n\\\\nf\\\\ns\\\\n= 2.303 × 1 × 0.8206 × 298 × log\\\\n10\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n(a) A Useful New State Function\\\\n\\\\nWe know that the heat absorbed at constant\\\\nvolume is equal to change in the internal\\\\nenergy i.e., ∆ U = qV. But most of chemical\\\\nreactions are carried out not at constant\\\\nvolume, but in flasks or test tubes under\\\\nconstant atmospheric pressure. We need to\\\\ndefine another state function which may be\\\\nsuitable under these conditions.\\\\n\\\\nWe may write equation (6.1) as\\\\n∆ U = qp – p ∆ V at constant pressure, where qp\\\\nis heat absorbed by the system and – p ∆ V\\\\nrepresent expansion work done by the system.\\\\n\\\\nLet us represent the initial state by\\\\nsubscript 1 and final state by 2\\\\n\\\\nFor finite changes at constant pressure, we\\\\ncan write equation 6.7 as\\\\n\\\\n168 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n1 mol of water is vapourised at 1 bar\\\\npressure and 100°C.\\\\nSolution\\\\n(i) The change H O 2 ( l )→H O g 2 ( )\\\\n\\\\n∆ H = ∆ U + ∆ ng R T\\\\nor ∆ U = ∆ H – ∆ ng R T , substituting the\\\\nvalues, we get\\\\n∆ U = −\\\\n× ×\\\\n−\\\\n− −\\\\n\\\\n41 00 1\\\\n\\\\n8 3 373\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n1 1\\\\n\\\\nkJ mol\\\\nJ mol K K\\\\n= 41.00 kJ mol-1 – 3.096 kJ mol-1\\\\n= 37.904 kJ mol–1\\\\n(b) Extensive and Intensive Properties\\\\nIn thermodynamics, a distinction is made\\\\nbetween extensive properties and intensive\\\\nproperties. An extensive property is a\\\\nproperty whose value depends on the\\\\nquantity or size of matter present in the\\\\nsystem. For example, mass, volume,\\\\ninternal energy, enthalpy, heat capacity, etc.\\\\nare extensive properties.\\\\nThose properties which do not depend\\\\non the quantity or size of matter present are\\\\nknown as intensive properties. For\\\\nexample temperature, density, pressure etc.\\\\nare intensive properties. A molar property,\\\\nχm, is the value of an extensive property χ of\\\\nthe system for 1 mol of the substance. If n\\\\nis the amount of matter, χ\\\\nχ\\\\nm= n is\\\\nindependent of the amount of matter. Other\\\\nexamples are molar volume, V m and molar\\\\nheat capacity, C m. Let us understand the\\\\ndistinction between extensive and intensive\\\\nproperties by considering a gas enclosed in\\\\na container of volume V and at temperature\\\\nT [Fig. 6.6(a)]. Let us make a partition such\\\\nthat volume is halved, each part [Fig. 6.6\\\\n(b)] now has one half of the original volume,\\\\nV\\\\n2 , but the temperature will still remain the\\\\nsame i.e., T. It is clear that volume is an\\\\nextensive property and temperature is an\\\\nintensive property.\\\\n(c) Heat Capacity\\\\nIn this sub-section, let us see how to measure\\\\nheat transferred to a system. This heat appears\\\\nas a rise in temperature of the system in case\\\\nof heat absorbed by the system.\\\\nThe increase of temperature is proportional\\\\nto the heat transferred\\\\nq coeff = × ∆ T\\\\nThe magnitude of the coefficient depends\\\\non the size, composition and nature of the\\\\nsystem. We can also write it as q = C ∆ T\\\\nThe coefficient, C is called the heat capacity.\\\\nThus, we can measure the heat supplied\\\\nby monitoring the temperature rise, provided\\\\nwe know the heat capacity.\\\\nWhen C is large, a given amount of heat\\\\nresults in only a small temperature rise. Water\\\\nhas a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy is\\\\nneeded to raise its temperature.\\\\nC is directly proportional to amount of\\\\nsubstance. The molar heat capacity of a\\\\nsubstance, Cm = C\\\\nn\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\n, is the heat capacity for\\\\none mole of the substance and is the quantity\\\\nof heat needed to raise the temperature of\\\\none mole by one degree celsius (or one\\\\nkelvin). Specific heat, also called specific heat\\\\ncapacity is the quantity of heat required to\\\\nraise the temperature of one unit mass of a\\\\nFig. 6.6(a) A gas at volume V and temperature T\\\\nFig. 6.6 (b) Partition, each part having half the\\\\nvolume of the gas\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 169\\\\nsubstance by one degree celsius (or one\\\\nkelvin). For finding out the heat, q , required\\\\nto raise the temperatures of a sample, we\\\\nmultiply the specific heat of the substance,\\\\nc, by the mass m, and temperatures change,\\\\n∆ T as\\\\n\\\\nq c m = × × T =∆ C T ∆ (6.11)\\\\n(d)The Relationship between Cp and CV\\\\nfor an Ideal Gas\\\\n\\\\nAt constant volume, the heat capacity, C is\\\\ndenoted by CV and at constant pressure, this\\\\nis denoted by Cp. Let us find the relationship\\\\nbetween the two.\\\\n\\\\nWe can write equation for heat, q\\\\n\\\\nat constant volume as qV = CV ∆ T ∆= U\\\\n\\\\nat constant pressure as qp = C Tp ∆ ∆= H\\\\n\\\\nThe difference between Cp and CV can be\\\\nderived for an ideal gas as:\\\\n\\\\nFor a mole of an ideal gas, ∆ H = ∆ U + ∆( pV )\\\\n\\\\nC Tp ∆ = C TV ∆ +R∆ T\\\\nCp = CV +R\\\\nCp – CV = R (6.13)\\\\n\\\\n6.3 MEASUREMENT OF ∆∆∆∆∆ U AND ∆∆∆∆∆ H :\\\\n\\\\nCALORIMETRY\\\\n\\\\nWe can measure energy changes associated\\\\nwith chemical or physical processes by an\\\\nexperimental technique called calorimetry. In\\\\ncalorimetry, the process is carried out in a\\\\nvessel called calorimeter, which is immersed\\\\nin a known volume of a liquid. Knowing the\\\\nheat capacity of the liquid in which calorimeter\\\\nis immersed and the heat capacity of\\\\ncalorimeter, it is possible to determine the heat\\\\nevolved in the process by measuring\\\\ntemperature changes. Measurements are\\\\nmade under two different conditions:\\\\n\\\\ni) at constant volume, qV\\\\nii) at constant pressure, qp\\\\n(a) ∆∆∆∆∆ U Measurements\\\\nFor chemical reactions, heat absorbed at\\\\nconstant volume, is measured in a bomb\\\\ncalorimeter (Fig. 6.7). Here, a steel vessel (the\\\\nbomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole\\\\ndevice is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is\\\\nimmersed in water bath to ensure that no heat\\\\nis lost to the surroundings. A combustible\\\\nsubstance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied\\\\nFig. 6.7 Bomb calorimeter\\\\nin the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the\\\\nreaction is transferred to the water around the\\\\nbomb and its temperature is monitored. Since\\\\nthe bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume does\\\\nnot change i.e., the energy changes associated\\\\nwith reactions are measured at constant\\\\nvolume. Under these conditions, no work is\\\\ndone as the reaction is carried out at constant\\\\nvolume in the bomb calorimeter. Even for\\\\nreactions involving gases, there is no work\\\\ndone as ∆ V = 0. Temperature change of the\\\\ncalorimeter produced by the completed\\\\nreaction is then converted to qV , by using the\\\\nknown heat capacity of the calorimeter with\\\\nthe help of equation 6.11.\\\\n\\\\n170 CHEMISTRY\\\\n(b) ∆∆∆∆∆ H Measurements\\\\n\\\\nMeasurement of heat change at constant pressure\\\\n(generally under atmospheric pressure) can be\\\\ndone in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 6.8. We know\\\\nthat ∆Η = qp (at constant p ) and, therefore, heat\\\\nabsorbed or evolved, qp at constant pressure is\\\\nalso called the heat of reaction or enthalpy of\\\\nreaction, ∆ rH.\\\\n\\\\nIn an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved,\\\\nand system loses heat to the surroundings.\\\\nTherefore, qp will be negative and ∆ rH will also\\\\nbe negative. Similarly in an endothermic\\\\nreaction, heat is absorbed, qp is positive and\\\\n∆ rH will be positive.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 6.6\\\\n1g of graphite is burnt in a bomb\\\\ncalorimeter in excess of oxygen at 298 K\\\\nand 1 atmospheric pressure according to\\\\nthe equation\\\\nC (graphite) + O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g)\\\\nDuring the reaction, temperature rises\\\\nfrom 298 K to 299 K.

It is, therefore, necessary that we must\\\\nspecify some standard conditions. The\\\\nstandard enthalpy of reaction is the\\\\nenthalpy change for a reaction when all\\\\nthe participating substances are in their\\\\nstandard states.\\\\n\\\\nThe standard state of a substance at', '6.4 A system which allows heat transfer\\\\nthrough its boundary.\\\\n\\\\n164 CHEMISTRY\\\\n(c) The general case\\\\n\\\\nLet us consider the general case in which a\\\\nchange of state is brought about both by\\\\ndoing work and by transfer of heat. We write\\\\nchange in internal energy for this case as:\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = q + w (6.1)\\\\n\\\\nFor a given change in state, q and w can\\\\nvary depending on how the change is carried\\\\nout. However, q +w = ∆ U will depend only on\\\\ninitial and final state. It will be independent of\\\\nthe way the change is carried out. If there is\\\\nno transfer of energy as heat or as work\\\\n(isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then\\\\n∆ U = 0.\\\\n\\\\nThe equation 6.1 i.e., ∆ U = q + w is\\\\nmathematical statement of the first law of\\\\nthermodynamics, which states that\\\\n\\\\nThe energy of an isolated system is\\\\nconstant.\\\\nIt is commonly stated as the law of\\\\nconservation of energy i.e., energy can neither\\\\nbe created nor be destroyed.\\\\n\\\\nNote: There is considerable difference between\\\\nthe character of the thermodynamic property\\\\nenergy and that of a mechanical property such\\\\nas volume. We can specify an unambiguous\\\\n(absolute) value for volume of a system in a\\\\nparticular state, but not the absolute value of\\\\nthe internal energy. However, we can measure\\\\nonly the changes in the internal energy, ∆ U of\\\\nthe system.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 6.1\\\\nExpress the change in internal energy of\\\\na system when\\\\n(i) No heat is absorbed by the system\\\\nfrom the surroundings, but work (w)\\\\nis done on the system.

It is important for us to\\\\nquantify these changes and relate them to the\\\\nchanges in the internal energy. Let us see how!\\\\n6.2.1 Work\\\\nFirst of all, let us concentrate on the nature of\\\\nwork a system can do. We will consider only\\\\nmechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.\\\\nFor understanding pressure-volume\\\\nwork, let us consider a cylinder which\\\\ncontains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with a\\\\nfrictionless piston. Total volume of the gas is\\\\nVi and pressure of the gas inside is p. If\\\\nexternal pressure is p ex which is greater than\\\\np , piston is moved inward till the pressure\\\\ninside becomes equal to p ex. Let this change\\\\nFig. 6.5(a) Work done on an ideal gas in a\\\\ncylinder when it is compressed by a\\\\nconstant external pressure, pex\\\\n(in single step) is equal to the shaded\\\\narea.\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 165\\\\nbe achieved in a single step and the final\\\\nvolume be Vf. During this compression,\\\\nsuppose piston moves a distance, l and is\\\\ncross-sectional area of the piston is A\\\\n[Fig. 6.5(a)].\\\\n\\\\nthen, volume change = l × A = ∆ V = ( Vf – Vi )\\\\n\\\\nWe also know,\\\\n\\\\nforce\\\\npressure\\\\narea\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, force on the piston = p ex. A\\\\nIf w is the work done on the system by\\\\nmovement of the piston then\\\\n\\\\nw = force × distance = pex. A. l\\\\n\\\\nThe negative sign of this expression is\\\\nrequired to obtain conventional sign for w,\\\\nwhich will be positive. It indicates that in case\\\\nof compression work is done on the system.\\\\nHere ( Vf – Vi ) will be negative and negative\\\\nmultiplied by negative will be positive. Hence\\\\nthe sign obtained for the work will be positive.\\\\nIf the pressure is not constant at every\\\\nstage of compression, but changes in number\\\\nof finite steps, work done on the gas will be\\\\nsummed over all the steps and will be equal\\\\n\\\\nto −∑ p V ∆ [Fig. 6.5 (b)]\\\\n\\\\n166 CHEMISTRY\\\\nother than reversible processes are known\\\\nas irreversible processes.\\\\n\\\\nIn chemistry, we face problems that can\\\\nbe solved if we relate the work term to the\\\\ninternal pressure of the system. We can\\\\nrelate work to internal pressure of the system\\\\nunder reversible conditions by writing\\\\nequation 6.3 as follows:\\\\n\\\\nw rev\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\n⇒ p =\\\\n\\\\nn R\\\\nTherefore, at constant temperature (isothermal\\\\nprocess),\\\\n\\\\nwrev= −∫ n R T = − n R\\\\n\\\\ndV\\\\nV\\\\n\\\\nf\\\\ni\\\\n\\\\n(6.5)\\\\n\\\\nFree expansion: Expansion of a gas in\\\\nvacuum ( pex = 0) is called free expansion. No\\\\nwork is done during free expansion of an ideal\\\\ngas whether the process is reversible or\\\\nirreversible (equation 6.2 and 6.3).\\\\n\\\\nNow, we can write equation 6.1 in number\\\\nof ways depending on the type of processes.\\\\n\\\\nLet us substitute w = – pex ∆ V (eq. 6.2) in\\\\nequation 6.1, and we get\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = q p − ex ∆ V\\\\nIf a process is carried out at constant volume\\\\n(∆ V = 0), then\\\\n\\\\n∆ U = qV\\\\nthe subscript V in qV^ denotes that heat is\\\\nsupplied at constant volume.\\\\n\\\\nIsothermal and free expansion of an\\\\nideal gas\\\\nFor isothermal ( T = constant) expansion of an\\\\nideal gas into vacuum ; w = 0 since pex = 0.\\\\nAlso, Joule determined experimentally that\\\\nq = 0; therefore, ∆ U = 0\\\\nEquation 6.1, ∆ U = q +w can be\\\\nexpressed for isothermal irreversible and\\\\nreversible changes as follows:\\\\n1. For isothermal irreversible change\\\\n    q = – w = pex ( Vf – Vi )\\\\n2. For isothermal reversible change\\\\n\\\\nq = – w = n R T ln\\\\nf\\\\ni\\\\nV\\\\nV\\\\n= 2.303 n R T log\\\\n\\\\nf\\\\ni\\\\n3. For adiabatic change, q = 0,\\\\n    ∆ U = wad\\\\n\\\\nProblem 6.2\\\\nTwo litres of an ideal gas at a pressure of\\\\n10 atm expands isothermally at 25 °C into\\\\na vacuum until its total volume is 10 litres.\\\\nHow much heat is absorbed and how much\\\\nwork is done in the expansion?\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe have q = – w = pex (10 – 2) = 0(8) = 0\\\\nNo work is done; no heat is absorbed.\\\\nProblem 6.3\\\\nConsider the same expansion, but this\\\\ntime against a constant external pressure\\\\nof 1 atm.\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe have q = – w = pex (8) = 8 litre-atm\\\\nProblem 6.4\\\\nConsider the expansion given in problem\\\\n6.2, for 1 mol of an ideal gas conducted\\\\nreversibly.\\\\nSolution\\\\nWe have q = – w = 2.303 nRT log\\\\n\\\\nf\\\\ns\\\\n= 2.303 × 1 × 0.8206 × 298 × log\\\\n10\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n(a) A Useful New State Function\\\\n\\\\nWe know that the heat absorbed at constant\\\\nvolume is equal to change in the internal\\\\nenergy i.e., ∆ U = qV. But most of chemical\\\\nreactions are carried out not at constant\\\\nvolume, but in flasks or test tubes under\\\\nconstant atmospheric pressure. We need to\\\\ndefine another state function which may be\\\\nsuitable under these conditions.\\\\n\\\\nWe may write equation (6.1) as\\\\n∆ U = qp – p ∆ V at constant pressure, where qp\\\\nis heat absorbed by the system and – p ∆ V\\\\nrepresent expansion work done by the system.\\\\n\\\\nLet us represent the initial state by\\\\nsubscript 1 and final state by 2\\\\n\\\\nFor finite changes at constant pressure, we\\\\ncan write equation 6.7 as\\\\n\\\\n168 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n1 mol of water is vapourised at 1 bar\\\\npressure and 100°C.\\\\nSolution\\\\n(i) The change H O 2 ( l )→H O g 2 ( )\\\\n\\\\n∆ H = ∆ U + ∆ ng R T\\\\nor ∆ U = ∆ H – ∆ ng R T , substituting the\\\\nvalues, we get\\\\n∆ U = −\\\\n× ×\\\\n−\\\\n− −\\\\n\\\\n41 00 1\\\\n\\\\n8 3 373\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n1 1\\\\n\\\\nkJ mol\\\\nJ mol K K\\\\n= 41.00 kJ mol-1 – 3.096 kJ mol-1\\\\n= 37.904 kJ mol–1\\\\n(b) Extensive and Intensive Properties\\\\nIn thermodynamics, a distinction is made\\\\nbetween extensive properties and intensive\\\\nproperties. An extensive property is a\\\\nproperty whose value depends on the\\\\nquantity or size of matter present in the\\\\nsystem. For example, mass, volume,\\\\ninternal energy, enthalpy, heat capacity, etc.\\\\nare extensive properties.\\\\nThose properties which do not depend\\\\non the quantity or size of matter present are\\\\nknown as intensive properties. For\\\\nexample temperature, density, pressure etc.\\\\nare intensive properties. A molar property,\\\\nχm, is the value of an extensive property χ of\\\\nthe system for 1 mol of the substance. If n\\\\nis the amount of matter, χ\\\\nχ\\\\nm= n is\\\\nindependent of the amount of matter. Other\\\\nexamples are molar volume, V m and molar\\\\nheat capacity, C m. Let us understand the\\\\ndistinction between extensive and intensive\\\\nproperties by considering a gas enclosed in\\\\na container of volume V and at temperature\\\\nT [Fig. 6.6(a)]. Let us make a partition such\\\\nthat volume is halved, each part [Fig. 6.6\\\\n(b)] now has one half of the original volume,\\\\nV\\\\n2 , but the temperature will still remain the\\\\nsame i.e., T. It is clear that volume is an\\\\nextensive property and temperature is an\\\\nintensive property.\\\\n(c) Heat Capacity\\\\nIn this sub-section, let us see how to measure\\\\nheat transferred to a system. This heat appears\\\\nas a rise in temperature of the system in case\\\\nof heat absorbed by the system.\\\\nThe increase of temperature is proportional\\\\nto the heat transferred\\\\nq coeff = × ∆ T\\\\nThe magnitude of the coefficient depends\\\\non the size, composition and nature of the\\\\nsystem. We can also write it as q = C ∆ T\\\\nThe coefficient, C is called the heat capacity.\\\\nThus, we can measure the heat supplied\\\\nby monitoring the temperature rise, provided\\\\nwe know the heat capacity.\\\\nWhen C is large, a given amount of heat\\\\nresults in only a small temperature rise. Water\\\\nhas a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy is\\\\nneeded to raise its temperature.\\\\nC is directly proportional to amount of\\\\nsubstance. The molar heat capacity of a\\\\nsubstance, Cm = C\\\\nn\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ed\\\\uf8ec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8f8\\\\uf8f7\\\\n\\\\n, is the heat capacity for\\\\none mole of the substance and is the quantity\\\\nof heat needed to raise the temperature of\\\\none mole by one degree celsius (or one\\\\nkelvin). Specific heat, also called specific heat\\\\ncapacity is the quantity of heat required to\\\\nraise the temperature of one unit mass of a\\\\nFig. 6.6(a) A gas at volume V and temperature T\\\\nFig. 6.6 (b) Partition, each part having half the\\\\nvolume of the gas\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 169\\\\nsubstance by one degree celsius (or one\\\\nkelvin). For finding out the heat, q , required\\\\nto raise the temperatures of a sample, we\\\\nmultiply the specific heat of the substance,\\\\nc, by the mass m, and temperatures change,\\\\n∆ T as\\\\n\\\\nq c m = × × T =∆ C T ∆ (6.11)\\\\n(d)The Relationship between Cp and CV\\\\nfor an Ideal Gas\\\\n\\\\nAt constant volume, the heat capacity, C is\\\\ndenoted by CV and at constant pressure, this\\\\nis denoted by Cp. Let us find the relationship\\\\nbetween the two.\\\\n\\\\nWe can write equation for heat, q\\\\n\\\\nat constant volume as qV = CV ∆ T ∆= U\\\\n\\\\nat constant pressure as qp = C Tp ∆ ∆= H\\\\n\\\\nThe difference between Cp and CV can be\\\\nderived for an ideal gas as:\\\\n\\\\nFor a mole of an ideal gas, ∆ H = ∆ U + ∆( pV )\\\\n\\\\nC Tp ∆ = C TV ∆ +R∆ T\\\\nCp = CV +R\\\\nCp – CV = R (6.13)\\\\n\\\\n6.3 MEASUREMENT OF ∆∆∆∆∆ U AND ∆∆∆∆∆ H :\\\\n\\\\nCALORIMETRY\\\\n\\\\nWe can measure energy changes associated\\\\nwith chemical or physical processes by an\\\\nexperimental technique called calorimetry. In\\\\ncalorimetry, the process is carried out in a\\\\nvessel called calorimeter, which is immersed\\\\nin a known volume of a liquid. Knowing the\\\\nheat capacity of the liquid in which calorimeter\\\\nis immersed and the heat capacity of\\\\ncalorimeter, it is possible to determine the heat\\\\nevolved in the process by measuring\\\\ntemperature changes. Measurements are\\\\nmade under two different conditions:\\\\n\\\\ni) at constant volume, qV\\\\nii) at constant pressure, qp\\\\n(a) ∆∆∆∆∆ U Measurements\\\\nFor chemical reactions, heat absorbed at\\\\nconstant volume, is measured in a bomb\\\\ncalorimeter (Fig. 6.7). Here, a steel vessel (the\\\\nbomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole\\\\ndevice is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is\\\\nimmersed in water bath to ensure that no heat\\\\nis lost to the surroundings. A combustible\\\\nsubstance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied\\\\nFig. 6.7 Bomb calorimeter\\\\nin the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the\\\\nreaction is transferred to the water around the\\\\nbomb and its temperature is monitored. Since\\\\nthe bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume does\\\\nnot change i.e., the energy changes associated\\\\nwith reactions are measured at constant\\\\nvolume. Under these conditions, no work is\\\\ndone as the reaction is carried out at constant\\\\nvolume in the bomb calorimeter. Even for\\\\nreactions involving gases, there is no work\\\\ndone as ∆ V = 0. Temperature change of the\\\\ncalorimeter produced by the completed\\\\nreaction is then converted to qV , by using the\\\\nknown heat capacity of the calorimeter with\\\\nthe help of equation 6.11.\\\\n\\\\n170 CHEMISTRY\\\\n(b) ∆∆∆∆∆ H Measurements\\\\n\\\\nMeasurement of heat change at constant pressure\\\\n(generally under atmospheric pressure) can be\\\\ndone in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 6.8. We know\\\\nthat ∆Η = qp (at constant p ) and, therefore, heat\\\\nabsorbed or evolved, qp at constant pressure is\\\\nalso called the heat of reaction or enthalpy of\\\\nreaction, ∆ rH.\\\\n\\\\nIn an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved,\\\\nand system loses heat to the surroundings.\\\\nTherefore, qp will be negative and ∆ rH will also\\\\nbe negative. Similarly in an endothermic\\\\nreaction, heat is absorbed, qp is positive and\\\\n∆ rH will be positive.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 6.6\\\\n1g of graphite is burnt in a bomb\\\\ncalorimeter in excess of oxygen at 298 K\\\\nand 1 atmospheric pressure according to\\\\nthe equation\\\\nC (graphite) + O 2 (g) → CO 2 (g)\\\\nDuring the reaction, temperature rises\\\\nfrom 298 K to 299 K.

The other examples of enthalpy of\\\\natomization can be\\\\n\\\\nCH 4 (g) → C(g) + 4H(g); ∆ aH^0 = 1665 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nNote that the products are only atoms of C\\\\nand H in gaseous phase. Now see the following\\\\nreaction:\\\\n\\\\nNa(s) → Na(g) ; ∆ aH^0 = 108.4 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\n178 CHEMISTRY\\\\nCH 4 (g) → CH 3 (g)+H(g);∆ bond H^0 = +427 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nCH 3 (g) → CH 2 (g)+H(g);∆ bond H^0 = +439 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nCH 2 (g) → CH(g)+H(g);∆ bond H^0 = +452 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nCH(g) → C(g)+H(g);∆ bond H^0 = +347 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nTherefore,\\\\n\\\\nCH 4 (g) → C(g)+4H(g);∆ a H^0 = 1665 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nIn such cases we use mean bond enthalpy\\\\nof C – H bond.\\\\n\\\\nFor example in CH 4 , ∆C–H H^0 is calculated as:\\\\n\\\\n∆C–H H^0 = ¼ (∆ a H^0 ) = ¼ (1665 kJ mol–1)\\\\n\\\\n= 416 kJ mol–1\\\\n\\\\nWe find that mean C–H bond enthalpy in\\\\nmethane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been found that\\\\nmean C–H bond enthalpies differ slightly from\\\\ncompound to compound, as in\\\\nCH 3 CH 2 Cl,CH 3 NO 2 , etc, but it does not differ\\\\nin a great deal*. Using Hess’s law, bond\\\\nenthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy\\\\nvalues of some single and multiple bonds are\\\\n\\\\ngiven in Table 6.3. The reaction enthalpies are\\\\nvery important quantities as these arise from\\\\nthe changes that accompany the breaking of\\\\nold bonds and formation of the new bonds.\\\\nWe can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas\\\\nphase, if we know different bond enthalpies.\\\\nThe standard enthalpy of reaction, ∆ rH^0 is\\\\nrelated to bond enthalpies of the reactants and\\\\nproducts in gas phase reactions as:\\\\n∆ r H^0\\\\n(^)\\\\n\\\\n0\\\\n* Note that symbol used for bond dissociation enthalpy and mean bond enthalpy is the same.\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 179\\\\napproximate and is valid when all substances\\\\n(reactants and products) in the reaction are in\\\\ngaseous state.\\\\n\\\\n(d) Lattice Enthalpy\\\\n\\\\nThe lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is\\\\nthe enthalpy change which occurs when one\\\\nmole of an ionic compound dissociates into its\\\\nions in gaseous state.\\\\n\\\\nNa Cl s+ −( )→Na g+( )+Cl g−( );\\\\n∆ latticeH^0 = +788 kJ mol–1\\\\nSince it is impossible to determine lattice\\\\nenthalpies directly by experiment, we use an\\\\nindirect method where we construct an\\\\nenthalpy diagram called a Born-Haber Cycle\\\\n(Fig. 6.9).\\\\n\\\\nLet us now calculate the lattice enthalpy\\\\nof Na+Cl–(s) by following steps given below :\\\\n\\\\nNa s →Na g( ) ( ), sublimation of sodium\\\\n\\\\nmetal, ∆ subH^0 = 108.4 kJ mol–1\\\\n2.

Therefore the solubility of most\\\\nsalts in water increases with rise of\\\\ntemperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very\\\\nhigh, the dissolution of the compound may not\\\\ntake place at all. Why do many fluorides tend\\\\nto be less soluble than the corresponding\\\\nchlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of\\\\nenthalpy changes may be made by using tables\\\\nof bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice\\\\nenergies (enthalpies).\\\\n(f) Enthalpy of Dilution\\\\nIt is known that enthalpy of solution is the\\\\nenthalpy change associated with the addition\\\\nof a specified amount of solute to the specified\\\\namount of solvent at a constant temperature\\\\nand pressure. This argument can be applied\\\\nto any solvent with slight modification.\\\\nEnthalpy change for dissolving one mole of\\\\ngaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water\\\\ncan be represented by the following equation.\\\\nFor convenience we will use the symbol aq. for\\\\nwater\\\\nHCl(g) + 10 aq. → HCl.10 aq.\\\\n∆H = –69.01 kJ / mol\\\\nLet us consider the following set of enthalpy\\\\nchanges:\\\\n(S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. → HCl.25 aq.\\\\n∆H = –72.03 kJ / mol\\\\n(S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. → HCl.40 aq.\\\\n∆H = –72.79 kJ / mol\\\\n(S-3) HCl(g) + ∞ aq. → HCl. ∞ aq.\\\\n∆H = –74.85 kJ / mol\\\\nThe values of ∆H show general dependence\\\\nof the enthalpy of solution on amount of solvent.\\\\nAs more and more solvent is used, the enthalpy\\\\nof solution approaches a limiting value, i.e, the\\\\nvalue in infinitely dilute solution. For\\\\nhydrochloric acid this value of ∆H is given\\\\nabove in equation (S-3).\\\\nimportance of the cycle is that, the sum of\\\\nthe enthalpy changes round a cycle is\\\\nzero. Applying Hess’s law, we get,\\\\n∆ latticeH^0 = 411.2 + 108.4 + 121 + 496 – 348.6\\\\n\\\\n∆ latticeH^0 = + 788kJ\\\\n\\\\nfor NaCl(s) d Na+(g) + Cl–(g)\\\\nInternal energy is smaller by 2RT ( because\\\\n∆ ng = 2) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol–1.\\\\n\\\\nNow we use the value of lattice enthalpy to\\\\ncalculate enthalpy of solution from the\\\\nexpression:\\\\n\\\\n∆ solH^0 = ∆ latticeH^0 + ∆ hydH^0\\\\n\\\\nFor one mole of NaCl(s),\\\\nlattice enthalpy = + 788 kJ mol–1\\\\nand ∆ hydH^0 = – 784 kJ mol–1( from the\\\\nliterature)\\\\n∆ sol H^0 = + 788 kJ mol–1 – 784 kJ mol–1\\\\n= + 4 kJ mol–1\\\\nThe dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied\\\\nby very little heat change.\\\\n\\\\n(e) Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : ∆∆∆∆∆ solH^00000 )\\\\n\\\\nEnthalpy of solution of a substance is the\\\\nenthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves\\\\nin a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy\\\\nof solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy\\\\nchange observed on dissolving the substance\\\\nin an infinite amount of solvent when the\\\\ninteractions between the ions (or solute\\\\nmolecules) are negligible.\\\\nWhen an ionic compound dissolves in a\\\\nsolvent, the ions leave their ordered positions on\\\\nthe crystal lattice. These are now more free in\\\\nsolution. But solvation of these ions (hydration\\\\nin case solvent is water) also occurs at the same\\\\ntime. This is shown diagrammatically, for an\\\\nionic compound, AB (s)\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 181\\\\nIf we subtract the first equation (equation\\\\nS-1) from the second equation (equation S-2)\\\\nin the above set of equations, we obtain–\\\\n\\\\nHCl.25 aq. + 15 aq. → HCl.40 aq.\\\\n∆H = [ –72.79 – (–72.03)] kJ / mol\\\\n= – 0.76 kJ / mol\\\\nThis value (–0.76kJ/mol) of ∆H is enthalpy\\\\nof dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from the\\\\nsurroundings when additional solvent is\\\\nadded to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution\\\\nof a solution is dependent on the original\\\\nconcentration of the solution and the amount\\\\nof solvent added.\\\\n\\\\n6.6 Spontaneity\\\\n\\\\nThe first law of thermodynamics tells us about\\\\nthe relationship between the heat absorbed\\\\nand the work performed on or by a system. It\\\\nputs no restrictions on the direction of heat\\\\nflow. However, the flow of heat is unidirectional\\\\nfrom higher temperature to lower\\\\ntemperature. In fact, all naturally occurring\\\\nprocesses whether chemical or physical will\\\\ntend to proceed spontaneously in one\\\\ndirection only. For example, a gas expanding\\\\nto fill the available volume, burning carbon\\\\nin dioxygen giving carbon dioxide.\\\\n\\\\nBut heat will not flow from colder body to\\\\nwarmer body on its own, the gas in a container\\\\nwill not spontaneously contract into one\\\\ncorner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon\\\\nand dioxygen spontaneously. These and many\\\\nother spontaneously occurring changes show\\\\nunidirectional change. We may ask ‘what is the\\\\ndriving force of spontaneously occurring\\\\nchanges? What determines the direction of a\\\\nspontaneous change? In this section, we shall\\\\nestablish some criterion for these processes\\\\nwhether these will take place or not.\\\\n\\\\nLet us first understand what do we mean\\\\nby spontaneous reaction or change? You may\\\\nthink by your common observation that\\\\nspontaneous reaction is one which occurs\\\\nimmediately when contact is made between\\\\nthe reactants. Take the case of combination of\\\\nhydrogen and oxygen. These gases may be\\\\nmixed at room temperature and left for many\\\\nyears without observing any perceptible\\\\nchange. Although the reaction is taking place\\\\n\\\\nbetween them, it is at an extremely slow rate.\\\\nIt is still called spontaneous reaction. So\\\\nspontaneity means ‘having the potential to\\\\nproceed without the assistance of external\\\\nagency’. However, it does not tell about the\\\\nrate of the reaction or process. Another aspect\\\\nof spontaneous reaction or process, as we see\\\\nis that these cannot reverse their direction on\\\\ntheir own. We may summarise it as follows:\\\\nA spontaneous process is an\\\\nirreversible process and may only be\\\\nreversed by some external agency.\\\\n(a)Is Decrease in Enthalpy a Criterion\\\\nfor Spontaneity?\\\\nIf we examine the phenomenon like flow of\\\\nwater down hill or fall of a stone on to the\\\\nground, we find that there is a net decrease in\\\\npotential energy in the direction of change. By\\\\nanalogy, we may be tempted to state that a\\\\nchemical reaction is spontaneous in a given\\\\ndirection, because decrease in energy has\\\\ntaken place, as in the case of exothermic\\\\nreactions. For example:\\\\n1\\\\n2 N^2 (g) +\\\\n\\\\nH 2 (g) = NH 3 (g) ;\\\\n∆ r H^0 = – 46.1 kJ mol–1\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\nH 2 (g) +\\\\n\\\\n182 CHEMISTRY\\\\nThese reactions though endothermic, are\\\\nspontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may\\\\nbe represented on an enthalpy diagram as\\\\nshown in Fig. 6.10(b).\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.10 (a) Enthalpy diagram for exothermic\\\\nreactions\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.10 (b) Enthalpy diagram for endothermic\\\\nreactions\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.11 Diffusion of two gases\\\\nrespectively and separated by a movable\\\\npartition [Fig. 6.11 (a)]. When the partition is\\\\nwithdrawn [Fig.6.11( b)], the gases begin to\\\\ndiffuse into each other and after a period of\\\\ntime, diffusion will be complete.\\\\nLet us examine the process. Before\\\\npartition, if we were to pick up the gas\\\\nmolecules from left container, we would be\\\\nsure that these will be molecules of gas A and\\\\nsimilarly if we were to pick up the gas\\\\nmolecules from right container, we would be\\\\nsure that these will be molecules of gas B. But,\\\\nif we were to pick up molecules from container\\\\nwhen partition is removed, we are not sure\\\\nwhether the molecules picked are of gas A or\\\\ngas B. We say that the system has become less\\\\npredictable or more chaotic.\\\\nWe may now formulate another postulate:\\\\nin an isolated system, there is always a\\\\ntendency for the systems’ energy to become\\\\nmore disordered or chaotic and this could be\\\\na criterion for spontaneous change!\\\\nAt this point, we introduce another\\\\nthermodynamic function, entropy denoted as\\\\nS. The above mentioned disorder is the\\\\nmanifestation of entropy. To form a mental\\\\nTherefore, it becomes obvious that while\\\\ndecrease in enthalpy may be a contributory\\\\nfactor for spontaneity, but it is not true for all\\\\ncases.\\\\n\\\\n(b) Entropy and Spontaneity\\\\n\\\\nThen, what drives the spontaneous process in\\\\na given direction? Let us examine such a case\\\\nin which ∆ H = 0 i.e., there is no change in\\\\nenthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.\\\\n\\\\nLet us consider diffusion of two gases into\\\\neach other in a closed container which is\\\\nisolated from the surroundings as shown in\\\\nFig. 6.11.\\\\n\\\\nThe two gases, say, gas A and gas B are\\\\nrepresented by black dots and white dots\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 183\\\\npicture, one can think of entropy as a measure\\\\nof the degree of randomness or disorder in the\\\\nsystem. The greater the disorder in an isolated\\\\nsystem, the higher is the entropy. As far as a\\\\nchemical reaction is concerned, this entropy\\\\nchange can be attributed to rearrangement of\\\\natoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants\\\\nto another (in the products). If the structure\\\\nof the products is very much disordered than\\\\nthat of the reactants, there will be a resultant\\\\nincrease in entropy. The change in entropy\\\\naccompanying a chemical reaction may be\\\\nestimated qualitatively by a consideration of\\\\nthe structures of the species taking part in the\\\\nreaction. Decrease of regularity in structure\\\\nwould mean increase in entropy. For a given\\\\nsubstance, the crystalline solid state is the\\\\nstate of lowest entropy (most ordered), The\\\\ngaseous state is state of highest entropy.\\\\n\\\\nNow let us try to quantify entropy. One way\\\\nto calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic\\\\ndistribution of energy among molecules would\\\\nbe through statistical method which is beyond\\\\nthe scope of this treatment. Other way would\\\\nbe to relate this process to the heat involved in\\\\na process which would make entropy a\\\\nthermodynamic concept. Entropy, like any\\\\nother thermodynamic property such as\\\\ninternal energy U and enthalpy H is a state\\\\nfunction and ∆ S is independent of path.\\\\n\\\\n∆S =\\\\n\\\\n184 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nbegin to move and oscillate about their\\\\nequilibrium positions in the lattice and\\\\nsystem becomes more disordered,\\\\ntherefore entropy increases.\\\\n(iii) Reactant, NaHCO 3 is a solid and it\\\\nhas low entropy.

By\\\\nanalogy, we may be tempted to state that a\\\\nchemical reaction is spontaneous in a given\\\\ndirection, because decrease in energy has\\\\ntaken place, as in the case of exothermic\\\\nreactions. For example:\\\\n1\\\\n2 N^2 (g) +\\\\n\\\\nH 2 (g) = NH 3 (g) ;\\\\n∆ r H^0 = – 46.1 kJ mol–1\\\\n1\\\\n2\\\\nH 2 (g) +\\\\n\\\\n182 CHEMISTRY\\\\nThese reactions though endothermic, are\\\\nspontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may\\\\nbe represented on an enthalpy diagram as\\\\nshown in Fig. 6.10(b).\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.10 (a) Enthalpy diagram for exothermic\\\\nreactions\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.10 (b) Enthalpy diagram for endothermic\\\\nreactions\\\\n\\\\nFig. 6.11 Diffusion of two gases\\\\nrespectively and separated by a movable\\\\npartition [Fig. 6.11 (a)]. When the partition is\\\\nwithdrawn [Fig.6.11( b)], the gases begin to\\\\ndiffuse into each other and after a period of\\\\ntime, diffusion will be complete.\\\\nLet us examine the process. Before\\\\npartition, if we were to pick up the gas\\\\nmolecules from left container, we would be\\\\nsure that these will be molecules of gas A and\\\\nsimilarly if we were to pick up the gas\\\\nmolecules from right container, we would be\\\\nsure that these will be molecules of gas B. But,\\\\nif we were to pick up molecules from container\\\\nwhen partition is removed, we are not sure\\\\nwhether the molecules picked are of gas A or\\\\ngas B. We say that the system has become less\\\\npredictable or more chaotic.\\\\nWe may now formulate another postulate:\\\\nin an isolated system, there is always a\\\\ntendency for the systems’ energy to become\\\\nmore disordered or chaotic and this could be\\\\na criterion for spontaneous change!\\\\nAt this point, we introduce another\\\\nthermodynamic function, entropy denoted as\\\\nS. The above mentioned disorder is the\\\\nmanifestation of entropy. To form a mental\\\\nTherefore, it becomes obvious that while\\\\ndecrease in enthalpy may be a contributory\\\\nfactor for spontaneity, but it is not true for all\\\\ncases.\\\\n\\\\n(b) Entropy and Spontaneity\\\\n\\\\nThen, what drives the spontaneous process in\\\\na given direction? Let us examine such a case\\\\nin which ∆ H = 0 i.e., there is no change in\\\\nenthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.\\\\n\\\\nLet us consider diffusion of two gases into\\\\neach other in a closed container which is\\\\nisolated from the surroundings as shown in\\\\nFig. 6.11.\\\\n\\\\nThe two gases, say, gas A and gas B are\\\\nrepresented by black dots and white dots\\\\n\\\\nTHERMODYNAMICS 183\\\\npicture, one can think of entropy as a measure\\\\nof the degree of randomness or disorder in the\\\\nsystem. The greater the disorder in an isolated\\\\nsystem, the higher is the entropy. As far as a\\\\nchemical reaction is concerned, this entropy\\\\nchange can be attributed to rearrangement of\\\\natoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants\\\\nto another (in the products). If the structure\\\\nof the products is very much disordered than\\\\nthat of the reactants, there will be a resultant\\\\nincrease in entropy. The change in entropy\\\\naccompanying a chemical reaction may be\\\\nestimated qualitatively by a consideration of\\\\nthe structures of the species taking part in the\\\\nreaction. Decrease of regularity in structure\\\\nwould mean increase in entropy. For a given\\\\nsubstance, the crystalline solid state is the\\\\nstate of lowest entropy (most ordered), The\\\\ngaseous state is state of highest entropy.\\\\n\\\\nNow let us try to quantify entropy. One way\\\\nto calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic\\\\ndistribution of energy among molecules would\\\\nbe through statistical method which is beyond\\\\nthe scope of this treatment. Other way would\\\\nbe to relate this process to the heat involved in\\\\na process which would make entropy a\\\\nthermodynamic concept. Entropy, like any\\\\nother thermodynamic property such as\\\\ninternal energy U and enthalpy H is a state\\\\nfunction and ∆ S is independent of path.\\\\n\\\\n∆S =\\\\n\\\\n184 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nbegin to move and oscillate about their\\\\nequilibrium positions in the lattice and\\\\nsystem becomes more disordered,\\\\ntherefore entropy increases.\\\\n(iii) Reactant, NaHCO 3 is a solid and it\\\\nhas low entropy.

This can happen in two ways;\\\\n(a) The positive entropy change of the system\\\\n\\\\ncan be ‘small’ in which case T must be large.\\\\n(b) The positive entropy change of the system\\\\ncan be ’large’, in which case T may be small.\\\\nThe former is one of the reasons why reactions\\\\nare often carried out at high temperature.\\\\nTable 6.4 summarises the effect of temperature\\\\non spontaneity of reactions.\\\\n(d) Entropy and Second Law of\\\\nThermodynamics\\\\nWe know that for an isolated system the\\\\nchange in energy remains constant. Therefore,\\\\nincrease in entropy in such systems is the\\\\nnatural direction of a spontaneous change.\\\\nThis, in fact is the second law of\\\\nthermodynamics. Like first law of\\\\nthermodynamics, second law can also be\\\\nstated in several ways. The second law of\\\\nthermodynamics explains why spontaneous\\\\nexothermic reactions are so common. In\\\\nexothermic reactions heat released by the\\\\nreaction increases the disorder of the\\\\nsurroundings and overall entropy change is\\\\npositive which makes the reaction\\\\nspontaneous.\\\\n(e) Absolute Entropy and Third Law of\\\\nThermodynamics\\\\nMolecules of a substance may move in a\\\\nstraight line in any direction, they may spin\\\\nlike a top and the bonds in the molecules may\\\\nstretch and compress. These motions of the\\\\nmolecule are called translational, rotational\\\\nand vibrational motion respectively. When\\\\ntemperature of the system rises, these motions\\\\nbecome more vigorous and entropy increases.\\\\nOn the other hand when temperature is\\\\nlowered, the entropy decreases. The entropy\\\\nof any pure crystalline substance\\\\napproaches zero as the temperature\\\\napproaches absolute zero. This is called\\\\nthird law of thermodynamics. This is so\\\\nbecause there is perfect order in a crystal at\\\\nabsolute zero. The statement is confined to\\\\npure crystalline solids because theoretical\\\\narguments and practical evidences have\\\\nshown that entropy of solutions and super\\\\ncooled liquids is not zero at 0 K. The\\\\nimportance of the third law lies in the fact that\\\\n\\\\nThe term low temperature and high temperature are relative.

Some\\\\nimportant aspects of equilibrium involving\\\\nphysical and chemical processes are dealt in\\\\nthis unit along with the equilibrium involving\\\\nions in aqueous solutions which is called as\\\\nionic equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\n7.1 Equilibrium in Physical Processes\\\\n\\\\nThe characteristics of system at equilibrium\\\\nare better understood if we examine some\\\\nphysical processes. The most familiar\\\\nexamples are phase transformation\\\\nprocesses, e.g.,\\\\nsolid liquid\\\\nliquid gas\\\\nsolid gas\\\\n7.1.1 Solid-Liquid Equilibrium\\\\nIce and water kept in a perfectly insulated\\\\nthermos flask (no exchange of heat between\\\\nits contents and the surroundings) at 273K\\\\nand the atmospheric pressure are in\\\\nequilibrium state and the system shows\\\\ninteresting characteristic features. We observe\\\\nthat the mass of ice and water do not change\\\\nwith time and the temperature remains\\\\nconstant. However, the equilibrium is not\\\\nstatic. The intense activity can be noticed at\\\\nthe boundary between ice and water.\\\\nMolecules from the liquid water collide against\\\\nice and adhere to it and some molecules of ice\\\\nescape into liquid phase. There is no change\\\\nof mass of ice and water, as the rates of transfer\\\\nof molecules from ice into water and of reverse\\\\ntransfer from water into ice are equal at\\\\natmospheric pressure and 273 K.\\\\nIt is obvious that ice and water are in\\\\nequilibrium only at particular temperature\\\\nand pressure. For any pure substance at\\\\natmospheric pressure, the temperature at\\\\nwhich the solid and liquid phases are at\\\\nequilibrium is called the normal melting point\\\\nor normal freezing point of the substance.\\\\nThe system here is in dynamic equilibrium and\\\\nwe can infer the following:\\\\n(i) Both the opposing processes occur\\\\nsimultaneously.\\\\n(ii) Both the processes occur at the same rate\\\\nso that the amount of ice and water\\\\nremains constant.\\\\n7.1.2 Liquid-Vapour Equilibrium\\\\nThis equilibrium can be better understood if\\\\nwe consider the example of a transparent box\\\\ncarrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer).\\\\nDrying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride\\\\n(or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for a\\\\nfew hours in the box. After removing the\\\\ndrying agent by tilting the box on one side, a\\\\nwatch glass (or petri dish) containing water is\\\\nquickly placed inside the box. It will be\\\\nobserved that the mercury level in the right\\\\nlimb of the manometer slowly increases and\\\\nfinally attains a constant value, that is, the\\\\npressure inside the box increases and reaches\\\\na constant value. Also the volume of water in\\\\nthe watch glass decreases (Fig. 7.1). Initially\\\\nthere was no water vapour (or very less) inside\\\\nthe box. As water evaporated the pressure in\\\\nthe box increased due to addition of water\\\\n\\\\n194 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nmolecules into the gaseous phase inside the\\\\nbox. The rate of evaporation is constant.\\\\nHowever, the rate of increase in pressure\\\\ndecreases with time due to condensation of\\\\nvapour into water. Finally it leads to an\\\\nequilibrium condition when there is no net\\\\nevaporation. This implies that the number of\\\\nwater molecules from the gaseous state into\\\\nthe liquid state also increases till the\\\\nequilibrium is attained i.e.,\\\\nrate of evaporation= rate of condensation\\\\nH 2 O(l) H 2 O (vap)\\\\nAt equilibrium the pressure exerted by the\\\\nwater molecules at a given temperature\\\\nremains constant and is called the equilibrium\\\\nvapour pressure of water (or just vapour\\\\npressure of water); vapour pressure of water\\\\nincreases with temperature. If the above\\\\nexperiment is repeated with methyl alcohol,\\\\nacetone and ether, it is observed that different\\\\nliquids have different equilibrium vapour\\\\npressures at the same temperature, and the\\\\nliquid which has a higher vapour pressure is\\\\nmore volatile and has a lower boiling point.\\\\nIf we expose three watch glasses\\\\ncontaining separately 1mL each of acetone,\\\\nethyl alcohol, and water to atmosphere and\\\\nrepeat the experiment with different volumes\\\\nof the liquids in a warmer room, it is observed\\\\nthat in all such cases the liquid eventually\\\\ndisappears and the time taken for complete\\\\nevaporation depends on (i) the nature of the\\\\nliquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the\\\\ntemperature. When the watch glass is open to\\\\nthe atmosphere, the rate of evaporation\\\\nremains constant but the molecules are\\\\ndispersed into large volume of the room. As a\\\\nconsequence the rate of condensation from\\\\nvapour to liquid state is much less than the\\\\nrate of', 'Like first law of\\\\nthermodynamics, second law can also be\\\\nstated in several ways.

For example, equilibria\\\\ninvolving O 2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play a\\\\ncrucial role in the transport and delivery of O 2 from our\\\\nlungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO\\\\nmolecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.\\\\nWhen a liquid evaporates in a closed container,\\\\nmolecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape the\\\\nliquid surface into the vapour phase and number of liquid\\\\nmolecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid surface\\\\nand are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise to a constant\\\\nvapour pressure because of an equilibrium in which the\\\\nnumber of molecules leaving the liquid equals the number\\\\nreturning to liquid from the vapour. We say that the system\\\\nhas reached equilibrium state at this stage. However, this\\\\nis not static equilibrium and there is a lot of activity at the\\\\nboundary between the liquid and the vapour. Thus, at\\\\nequilibrium , the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of\\\\ncondensation. It may be represented by\\\\nH 2 O (l)  H 2 O (vap)\\\\nThe double half arrows indicate that the processes in\\\\nboth the directions are going on simultaneously. The mixture\\\\nof reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called\\\\nan equilibrium mixture.\\\\nEquilibrium can be established for both physical\\\\nprocesses and chemical reactions. The reaction may be fast\\\\nor slow depending on the experimental conditions and the\\\\nnature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed vessel\\\\nat a particular temperature react to give products, the\\\\nconcentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing, while\\\\nthose of products keep on increasing for some time after\\\\nwhich there is no change in the concentrations of either of\\\\nthe reactants or products.

It is due to\\\\nthis dynamic equilibrium stage that there is\\\\nno change in the concentrations of various\\\\nspecies in the reaction mixture.

Some\\\\nimportant aspects of equilibrium involving\\\\nphysical and chemical processes are dealt in\\\\nthis unit along with the equilibrium involving\\\\nions in aqueous solutions which is called as\\\\nionic equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\n7.1 Equilibrium in Physical Processes\\\\n\\\\nThe characteristics of system at equilibrium\\\\nare better understood if we examine some\\\\nphysical processes. The most familiar\\\\nexamples are phase transformation\\\\nprocesses, e.g.,\\\\nsolid liquid\\\\nliquid gas\\\\nsolid gas\\\\n7.1.1 Solid-Liquid Equilibrium\\\\nIce and water kept in a perfectly insulated\\\\nthermos flask (no exchange of heat between\\\\nits contents and the surroundings) at 273K\\\\nand the atmospheric pressure are in\\\\nequilibrium state and the system shows\\\\ninteresting characteristic features. We observe\\\\nthat the mass of ice and water do not change\\\\nwith time and the temperature remains\\\\nconstant. However, the equilibrium is not\\\\nstatic. The intense activity can be noticed at\\\\nthe boundary between ice and water.\\\\nMolecules from the liquid water collide against\\\\nice and adhere to it and some molecules of ice\\\\nescape into liquid phase. There is no change\\\\nof mass of ice and water, as the rates of transfer\\\\nof molecules from ice into water and of reverse\\\\ntransfer from water into ice are equal at\\\\natmospheric pressure and 273 K.\\\\nIt is obvious that ice and water are in\\\\nequilibrium only at particular temperature\\\\nand pressure. For any pure substance at\\\\natmospheric pressure, the temperature at\\\\nwhich the solid and liquid phases are at\\\\nequilibrium is called the normal melting point\\\\nor normal freezing point of the substance.\\\\nThe system here is in dynamic equilibrium and\\\\nwe can infer the following:\\\\n(i) Both the opposing processes occur\\\\nsimultaneously.\\\\n(ii) Both the processes occur at the same rate\\\\nso that the amount of ice and water\\\\nremains constant.\\\\n7.1.2 Liquid-Vapour Equilibrium\\\\nThis equilibrium can be better understood if\\\\nwe consider the example of a transparent box\\\\ncarrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer).\\\\nDrying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride\\\\n(or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for a\\\\nfew hours in the box. After removing the\\\\ndrying agent by tilting the box on one side, a\\\\nwatch glass (or petri dish) containing water is\\\\nquickly placed inside the box. It will be\\\\nobserved that the mercury level in the right\\\\nlimb of the manometer slowly increases and\\\\nfinally attains a constant value, that is, the\\\\npressure inside the box increases and reaches\\\\na constant value. Also the volume of water in\\\\nthe watch glass decreases (Fig. 7.1). Initially\\\\nthere was no water vapour (or very less) inside\\\\nthe box. As water evaporated the pressure in\\\\nthe box increased due to addition of water\\\\n\\\\n194 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nmolecules into the gaseous phase inside the\\\\nbox. The rate of evaporation is constant.\\\\nHowever, the rate of increase in pressure\\\\ndecreases with time due to condensation of\\\\nvapour into water. Finally it leads to an\\\\nequilibrium condition when there is no net\\\\nevaporation. This implies that the number of\\\\nwater molecules from the gaseous state into\\\\nthe liquid state also increases till the\\\\nequilibrium is attained i.e.,\\\\nrate of evaporation= rate of condensation\\\\nH 2 O(l) H 2 O (vap)\\\\nAt equilibrium the pressure exerted by the\\\\nwater molecules at a given temperature\\\\nremains constant and is called the equilibrium\\\\nvapour pressure of water (or just vapour\\\\npressure of water); vapour pressure of water\\\\nincreases with temperature. If the above\\\\nexperiment is repeated with methyl alcohol,\\\\nacetone and ether, it is observed that different\\\\nliquids have different equilibrium vapour\\\\npressures at the same temperature, and the\\\\nliquid which has a higher vapour pressure is\\\\nmore volatile and has a lower boiling point.\\\\nIf we expose three watch glasses\\\\ncontaining separately 1mL each of acetone,\\\\nethyl alcohol, and water to atmosphere and\\\\nrepeat the experiment with different volumes\\\\nof the liquids in a warmer room, it is observed\\\\nthat in all such cases the liquid eventually\\\\ndisappears and the time taken for complete\\\\nevaporation depends on (i) the nature of the\\\\nliquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the\\\\ntemperature. When the watch glass is open to\\\\nthe atmosphere, the rate of evaporation\\\\nremains constant but the molecules are\\\\ndispersed into large volume of the room. As a\\\\nconsequence the rate of condensation from\\\\nvapour to liquid state is much less than the\\\\nrate of evaporation. These are open systems\\\\nand it is not possible to reach equilibrium in\\\\nan open system.\\\\nWater and water vapour are in equilibrium\\\\nposition at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar)\\\\nand at 100°C in a closed vessel. The boiling\\\\npoint of water is 100°C at 1.013 bar pressure.\\\\nFor any pure liquid at one atmospheric\\\\npressure (1.013 bar), the temperature at\\\\nwhich the liquid and vapours are at\\\\nequilibrium is called normal boiling point of\\\\nthe liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends\\\\non the atmospheric pressure. It depends on\\\\nthe altitude of the place; at high altitude the\\\\nboiling point decreases.\\\\n7.1.3 Solid – Vapour Equilibrium\\\\nLet us now consider the systems where solids\\\\nsublime to vapour phase. If we place solid iodine\\\\nin a closed vessel, after sometime the vessel gets\\\\nfilled up with violet vapour and the intensity of\\\\ncolour increases with time. After certain time the\\\\nintensity of colour becomes constant and at this\\\\nstage equilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine\\\\nsublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine\\\\nvapour condenses to give solid iodine. The\\\\nequilibrium can be represented as,\\\\nI 2 (solid)\\\\n\\\\nI 2 (vapour)\\\\nOther examples showing this kind of\\\\nequilibrium are,\\\\nCamphor (solid)  Camphor (vapour)\\\\nNH 4 Cl (solid)  NH 4 Cl (vapour)\\\\nFig.7.1 Measuring equilibrium vapour pressure of water at a constant temperature\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 195\\\\n\\\\n7.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution of\\\\nSolid or Gases in Liquids\\\\nSolids in liquids\\\\nWe know from our experience that we can\\\\ndissolve only a limited amount of salt or sugar\\\\nin a given amount of water at room\\\\ntemperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup\\\\nsolution by dissolving sugar at a higher\\\\ntemperature, sugar crystals separate out if we\\\\ncool the syrup to the room temperature. We\\\\ncall it a saturated solution when no more of\\\\nsolute can be dissolved in it at a given\\\\ntemperature. The concentration of the solute\\\\nin a saturated solution depends upon the\\\\ntemperature. In a saturated solution, a\\\\ndynamic equilibrium exits between the solute\\\\nmolecules in the solid state and in the solution:\\\\nSugar (solution) Sugar (solid), and\\\\nthe rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of\\\\ncrystallisation of sugar.\\\\nEquality of the two rates and dynamic\\\\nnature of equilibrium has been confirmed with\\\\nthe help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some\\\\nradioactive sugar into saturated solution of\\\\nnon-radioactive sugar, then after some time\\\\nradioactivity is observed both in the solution\\\\nand in the solid sugar. Initially there were no\\\\nradioactive sugar molecules in the solution\\\\nbut due to dynamic nature of equilibrium,\\\\nthere is exchange between the radioactive and\\\\nnon-radioactive sugar molecules between the\\\\ntwo phases. The ratio of the radioactive to non-\\\\nradioactive molecules in the solution increases\\\\ntill it attains a constant value.\\\\nGases in liquids\\\\nWhen a soda water bottle is opened, some of\\\\nthe carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes\\\\nout rapidly. The phenomenon arises due to\\\\ndifference in solubility of carbon dioxide at\\\\ndifferent pressures. There is equilibrium\\\\nbetween the molecules in the gaseous state\\\\nand the molecules dissolved in the liquid\\\\nunder pressure i.e.,\\\\nCO 2 (gas) CO 2 (in solution)\\\\nThis equilibrium is governed by Henry’s\\\\nlaw, which states that the mass of a gas\\\\ndissolved in a given mass of a solvent at\\\\nany temperature is proportional to the\\\\npressure of the gas above the solvent. This\\\\namount decreases with increase of\\\\ntemperature. The soda water bottle is sealed\\\\nunder pressure of gas when its solubility in\\\\nwater is high. As soon as the bottle is opened,\\\\nsome of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas\\\\nescapes to reach a new equilibrium condition\\\\nrequired for the lower pressure, namely its\\\\npartial pressure in the atmosphere. This is how\\\\nthe soda water in bottle when left open to the\\\\nair for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be\\\\ngeneralised that:\\\\n(i) For solid liquid equilibrium, there is\\\\nonly one temperature (melting point) at\\\\n1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two phases\\\\ncan coexist. If there is no exchange of heat\\\\nwith the surroundings, the mass of the two\\\\nphases remains constant.\\\\n(ii) For liquid vapour equilibrium, the\\\\nvapour pressure is constant at a given\\\\ntemperature.\\\\n(iii)For dissolution of solids in liquids, the\\\\nsolubility is constant at a given\\\\ntemperature.\\\\n(iv)For dissolution of gases in liquids, the\\\\nconcentration of a gas in liquid is\\\\nproportional to the pressure\\\\n(concentration) of the gas over the liquid.\\\\nThese observations are summarised in\\\\nTable 7.1\\\\nLiquid Vapour p H 2 Oconstant at given\\\\nH 2 O (l) H 2 O (g) temperature\\\\nSolid Liquid Melting point is fixed at\\\\nH 2 O (s) H 2 O (l) constant pressure\\\\nSolute(s) Solute Concentration of solute\\\\n(solution) in solution is constant\\\\nSugar(s) Sugar at a given temperature\\\\n(solution)\\\\nGas(g) Gas (aq) [gas(aq)]/[gas(g)] is\\\\nconstant at a given\\\\ntemperature\\\\nCO 2 (g) CO 2 (aq) [CO 2 (aq)]/[CO 2 (g)] is\\\\nconstant at a given\\\\ntemperature\\\\nTable 7.1 Some Features of Physical\\\\nEquilibria\\\\nProcess Conclusion\\\\n\\\\n196 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n7.1.5 General Characteristics of Equilibria\\\\nInvolving Physical Processes\\\\n\\\\nFor the physical processes discussed above,\\\\nfollowing characteristics are common to the\\\\nsystem at equilibrium:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Equilibrium is possible only in a closed\\\\nsystem at a given temperature.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at the\\\\nsame rate and there is a dynamic but\\\\nstable condition.\\\\n\\\\n(iii)All measurable properties of the system\\\\nremain constant.\\\\n\\\\n(iv)When equilibrium is attained for a physical\\\\nprocess, it is characterised by constant\\\\nvalue of one of its parameters at a given\\\\ntemperature. Table 7.1 lists such\\\\nquantities.\\\\n(v) The magnitude of such quantities at any\\\\nstage indicates the extent to which the\\\\nphysical process has proceeded before\\\\nreaching equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\n7.2 Equilibrium in Chemical Processes – Dynamic Equilibrium\\\\n\\\\nAnalogous to the physical systems chemical\\\\nreactions also attain a state of equilibrium.\\\\nThese reactions can occur both in forward\\\\nand backward directions. When the rates of\\\\nthe forward and reverse reactions become\\\\nequal, the concentrations of the reactants\\\\nand the products remain constant. This is\\\\nthe stage of chemical equilibrium. This\\\\nequilibrium is dynamic in nature as it\\\\nconsists of a forward reaction in which the\\\\nreactants give product(s) and reverse\\\\nreaction in which product(s) gives the\\\\noriginal reactants.\\\\n\\\\nFor a better comprehension, let us\\\\nconsider a general case of a reversible reaction,\\\\n\\\\nA + B C + D\\\\nWith passage of time, there is\\\\naccumulation of the products C and D and\\\\ndepletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 7.2).\\\\nThis leads to a decrease in the rate of forward\\\\nreaction and an increase in he rate of the\\\\nreverse reaction,\\\\n\\\\nFig. 7.2 Attainment of chemical equilibrium.\\\\nEventually, the two reactions occur at the\\\\nsame rate and the system reaches a state of\\\\nequilibrium.\\\\nSimilarly, the reaction can reach the state of\\\\nequilibrium even if we start with only C and D;\\\\nthat is, no A and B being present initially, as the\\\\nequilibrium can be reached from either direction.\\\\nThe dynamic nature of chemical\\\\nequilibrium can be demonstrated in the\\\\nsynthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process. In\\\\na series of experiments, Haber started with\\\\nknown amounts of dinitrogen and dihydrogen\\\\nmaintained at high temperature and pressure\\\\nand at regular intervals determined the\\\\namount of ammonia present. He was\\\\nsuccessful in determining also the\\\\nconcentration of unreacted dihydrogen and\\\\ndinitrogen. Fig. 7.4 (page 191) shows that after\\\\na certain time the composition of the mixture\\\\nremains the same even though some of the\\\\nreactants are still present. This constancy in\\\\ncomposition indicates that the reaction has\\\\nreached equilibrium. In order to understand\\\\nthe dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis\\\\nof ammonia is carried out with exactly the\\\\nsame starting conditions (of partial pressure\\\\nand temperature) but using D 2 (deuterium)\\\\nin place of H 2. The reaction mixtures starting\\\\neither with H 2 or D 2 reach equilibrium with\\\\nthe same composition, except that D 2 and ND 3\\\\nare present instead of H 2 and NH 3. After\\\\nequilibrium is attained, these two mixtures\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 197\\\\n\\\\nDynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity\\\\nEquilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic\\\\nnature. This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible\\\\nin a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing\\\\nthe following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.\\\\nTake two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes\\\\neach of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of\\\\n3-5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this\\\\npurpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder\\\\n(number 2) empty.\\\\nPut one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder\\\\n1, close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its\\\\nlower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured\\\\nwater in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring\\\\ncoloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you\\\\nnotice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant.\\\\nIf you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will\\\\nnot be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take\\\\nanalogy of ‘level’ of coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the\\\\ntwo cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy\\\\nof level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking\\\\ntwo tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in\\\\ntwo cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two\\\\ncylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning.\\\\nFig.7.3 Demonstrating dynamic nature of equilibrium. (a) initial stage (b) final stage after the\\\\nequilibrium is attained.\\\\n\\\\n198 CHEMISTRY\\\\n2NH 3 (g) N 2 (g) + 3H 2 (g)\\\\nSimilarly let us consider the reaction,\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g) 2HI(g). If we start with equal\\\\ninitial concentration of H 2 and I 2 , the reaction\\\\nproceeds in the forward direction and the\\\\nconcentration of H 2 and I 2 decreases while that\\\\nof HI increases, until all of these become\\\\nconstant at equilibrium (Fig. 7.5). We can also\\\\nstart with HI alone and make the reaction to\\\\nproceed in the reverse direction; the\\\\nconcentration of HI will decrease and\\\\nconcentration of H 2 and I 2 will increase until\\\\nthey all become constant when equilibrium is\\\\nreached (Fig.7.5). If total number of H and I\\\\natoms are same in a given volume, the same\\\\nequilibrium mixture is obtained whether we\\\\nstart it from pure reactants or pure product.\\\\n(H 2 , N 2 , NH 3 and D 2 , N 2 , ND 3 ) are mixed\\\\ntogether and left for a while. Later, when this\\\\nmixture is analysed, it is found that the\\\\nconcentration of ammonia is just the same as\\\\nbefore. However, when this mixture is\\\\nanalysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found\\\\nthat ammonia and all deuterium containing\\\\nforms of ammonia (NH 3 , NH 2 D, NHD 2 and ND 3 )\\\\nand dihydrogen and its deutrated forms\\\\n(H 2 , HD and D 2 ) are present. Thus one can\\\\nconclude that scrambling of H and D atoms\\\\nin the molecules must result from a\\\\ncontinuation of the forward and reverse\\\\nreactions in the mixture. If the reaction had\\\\nsimply stopped when they reached\\\\nequilibrium, then there would have been no\\\\nmixing of isotopes in this way.\\\\n\\\\nUse of isotope (deuterium) in the formation\\\\nof ammonia clearly indicates that chemical\\\\nreactions reach a state of dynamic\\\\nequilibrium in which the rates of forward\\\\nand reverse reactions are equal and there\\\\nis no net change in composition.\\\\n\\\\nEquilibrium can be attained from both\\\\nsides, whether we start reaction by taking,\\\\nH 2 (g) and N 2 (g) and get NH 3 (g) or by taking\\\\nNH 3 (g) and decomposing it into N 2 (g) and\\\\nH 2 (g).\\\\n\\\\nN 2 (g) + 3H 2 (g) 2NH 3 (g)\\\\nFig 7.4 Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction\\\\nFig.7.5 Chemical equilibrium in the reaction\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g)  2HI(g) can be attained\\\\nfrom either direction\\\\n\\\\n7.3 Law of Chemical Equilibrium and Equilibrium Constant\\\\n\\\\nA mixture of reactants and products in the\\\\nequilibrium state is called an equilibrium\\\\nmixture. In this section we shall address a\\\\nnumber of important questions about the\\\\ncomposition of equilibrium mixtures: What is\\\\nthe relationship between the concentrations of\\\\nreactants and products in an equilibrium\\\\nmixture?

The\\\\nlast question in particular is important when\\\\nchoosing conditions for synthesis of industrial\\\\nchemicals such as H 2 , NH 3 , CaO etc.\\\\nTo answer these questions, let us consider\\\\na general reversible reaction:\\\\nA + B C + D\\\\nwhere A and B are the reactants, C and D are\\\\nthe products in the balanced chemical\\\\nequation. On the basis of experimental studies\\\\nof many reversible reactions, the Norwegian\\\\nchemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and Peter\\\\nWaage proposed in 1864 that the\\\\nconcentrations in an equilibrium mixture are\\\\nrelated by the following equilibrium\\\\nequation,\\\\nKc =[ ][ ]\\\\n[ ][ ]\\\\n\\\\nC D\\\\n\\\\nA B\\\\n\\\\n(7.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant\\\\nand the expression on the right side is called\\\\nthe equilibrium constant expression.\\\\nThe equilibrium equation is also known as\\\\nthe law of mass action because in the early\\\\ndays of chemistry, concentration was called\\\\n“active mass”. In order to appreciate their work\\\\nbetter, let us consider reaction between\\\\ngaseous H 2 and I 2 carried out in a sealed vessel\\\\nat 731K.\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g) 2HI(g)\\\\n1 mol 1 mol 2 mol\\\\nSix sets of experiments with varying initial\\\\nconditions were performed, starting with only\\\\ngaseous H 2 and I 2 in a sealed reaction vessel\\\\nin first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and\\\\nonly HI in other two experiments (5 and 6).\\\\nExperiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed\\\\ntaking different concentrations of H 2 and / or\\\\nI 2 , and with time it was observed that intensity\\\\nof the purple colour remained constant and\\\\nequilibrium was attained. Similarly, for\\\\nexperiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was\\\\nattained from the opposite direction.\\\\nData obtained from all six sets of\\\\nexperiments are given in Table 7.2.\\\\nIt is evident from the experiments 1, 2, 3\\\\nand 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen\\\\nreacted = number of moles of iodine reacted =\\\\n½ (number of moles of HI formed).

It can be seen that in this expression\\\\nthe power of the concentration for reactants\\\\nand products are actually the stoichiometric\\\\ncoefficients in the equation for the chemical\\\\nreaction. Thus, for the reaction H 2 (g) + I 2 (g)\\\\n2HI(g), following equation 7.1, the equilibrium\\\\nconstant Kc is written as,\\\\n\\\\nKc = [HI(g)]eq^2 / [H 2 (g)]eq [I 2 (g)]eq (7.2)\\\\n\\\\nGenerally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for\\\\nequilibrium) is omitted from the concentration\\\\nterms. It is taken for granted that the\\\\nconcentrations in the expression for Kc are\\\\nequilibrium values. We, therefore, write,\\\\n\\\\nKc = [HI(g)]^2 / [H 2 (g)] [I 2 (g)] (7.3)\\\\n\\\\nThe subscript ‘ c ’ indicates that Kc is\\\\nexpressed in concentrations of mol L–1.\\\\n\\\\nAt a given temperature, the product of\\\\nconcentrations of the reaction products\\\\nraised to the respective stoichiometric\\\\ncoefficient in the balanced chemical\\\\nequation divided by the product of\\\\nconcentrations of the reactants raised to\\\\ntheir individual stoichiometric coefficients\\\\nhas a constant value.

If we place solid iodine\\\\nin a closed vessel, after sometime the vessel gets\\\\nfilled up with violet vapour and the intensity of\\\\ncolour increases with time. After certain time the\\\\nintensity of colour becomes constant and at this\\\\nstage equilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine\\\\nsublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine\\\\nvapour condenses to give solid iodine.

If we make a thick sugar syrup\\\\nsolution by dissolving sugar at a higher\\\\ntemperature, sugar crystals separate out if we\\\\ncool the syrup to the room temperature. We\\\\ncall it a saturated solution when no more of\\\\nsolute can be dissolved in it at a given\\\\ntemperature. The concentration of the solute\\\\nin a saturated solution depends upon the\\\\ntemperature. In a saturated solution, a\\\\ndynamic equilibrium exits between the solute\\\\nmolecules in the solid state and in the solution:\\\\nSugar (solution) Sugar (solid), and\\\\nthe rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of\\\\ncrystallisation of sugar.\\\\nEquality of the two rates and dynamic\\\\nnature of equilibrium has been confirmed with\\\\nthe help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some\\\\nradioactive sugar into saturated solution of\\\\nnon-radioactive sugar, then after some time\\\\nradioactivity is observed both in the solution\\\\nand in the solid sugar. Initially there were no\\\\nradioactive sugar molecules in the solution\\\\nbut due to dynamic nature of equilibrium,\\\\nthere is exchange between the radioactive and\\\\nnon-radioactive sugar molecules between the\\\\ntwo phases. The ratio of the radioactive to non-\\\\nradioactive molecules in the solution increases\\\\ntill it attains a constant value.\\\\nGases in liquids\\\\nWhen a soda water bottle is opened, some of\\\\nthe carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes\\\\nout rapidly. The phenomenon arises due to\\\\ndifference in solubility of carbon dioxide at\\\\ndifferent pressures. There is equilibrium\\\\nbetween the molecules in the gaseous state\\\\nand the molecules dissolved in the liquid\\\\nunder pressure i.e.,\\\\nCO 2 (gas) CO 2 (in solution)\\\\nThis equilibrium is governed by Henry’s\\\\nlaw, which states that the mass of a gas\\\\ndissolved in a given mass of a solvent at\\\\nany temperature is proportional to the\\\\npressure of the gas above the solvent. This\\\\namount decreases with increase of\\\\ntemperature. The soda water bottle is sealed\\\\nunder pressure of gas when its solubility in\\\\nwater is high. As soon as the bottle is opened,\\\\nsome of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas\\\\nescapes to reach a new equilibrium condition\\\\nrequired for the lower pressure, namely its\\\\npartial pressure in the atmosphere. This is how\\\\nthe soda water in bottle when left open to the\\\\nair for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be\\\\ngeneralised that:\\\\n(i) For solid liquid equilibrium, there is\\\\nonly one temperature (melting point) at\\\\n1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two phases\\\\ncan coexist. If there is no exchange of heat\\\\nwith the surroundings, the mass of the two\\\\nphases remains constant.\\\\n(ii) For liquid vapour equilibrium, the\\\\nvapour pressure is constant at a given\\\\ntemperature.\\\\n(iii)For dissolution of solids in liquids, the\\\\nsolubility is constant at a given\\\\ntemperature.\\\\n(iv)For dissolution of gases in liquids, the\\\\nconcentration of a gas in liquid is\\\\nproportional to the pressure\\\\n(concentration) of the gas over the liquid.\\\\nThese observations are summarised in\\\\nTable 7.1\\\\nLiquid Vapour p H 2 Oconstant at given\\\\nH 2 O (l) H 2 O (g) temperature\\\\nSolid Liquid Melting point is fixed at\\\\nH 2 O (s) H 2 O (l) constant pressure\\\\nSolute(s) Solute Concentration of solute\\\\n(solution) in solution is constant\\\\nSugar(s) Sugar at a given temperature\\\\n(solution)\\\\nGas(g) Gas (aq) [gas(aq)]/[gas(g)] is\\\\nconstant at a given\\\\ntemperature\\\\nCO 2 (g) CO 2 (aq) [CO 2 (aq)]/[CO 2 (g)] is\\\\nconstant at a given\\\\ntemperature\\\\nTable 7.1 Some Features of Physical\\\\nEquilibria\\\\nProcess Conclusion\\\\n\\\\n196 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n7.1.5 General Characteristics of Equilibria\\\\nInvolving Physical Processes\\\\n\\\\nFor the physical processes discussed above,\\\\nfollowing characteristics are common to the\\\\nsystem at equilibrium:\\\\n\\\\n(i) Equilibrium is possible only in a closed\\\\nsystem at a given temperature.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at the\\\\nsame rate and there is a dynamic but\\\\nstable condition.\\\\n\\\\n(iii)All measurable properties of the system\\\\nremain constant.\\\\n\\\\n(iv)When equilibrium is attained for a physical\\\\nprocess, it is characterised by constant\\\\nvalue of one of its parameters at a given\\\\ntemperature. Table 7.1 lists such\\\\nquantities.\\\\n(v) The magnitude of such quantities at any\\\\nstage indicates the extent to which the\\\\nphysical process has proceeded before\\\\nreaching equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\n7.2 Equilibrium in Chemical Processes – Dynamic Equilibrium\\\\n\\\\nAnalogous to the physical systems chemical\\\\nreactions also attain a state of equilibrium.\\\\nThese reactions can occur both in forward\\\\nand backward directions. When the rates of\\\\nthe forward and reverse reactions become\\\\nequal, the concentrations of the reactants\\\\nand the products remain constant. This is\\\\nthe stage of chemical equilibrium. This\\\\nequilibrium is dynamic in nature as it\\\\nconsists of a forward reaction in which the\\\\nreactants give product(s) and reverse\\\\nreaction in which product(s) gives the\\\\noriginal reactants.\\\\n\\\\nFor a better comprehension, let us\\\\nconsider a general case of a reversible reaction,\\\\n\\\\nA + B C + D\\\\nWith passage of time, there is\\\\naccumulation of the products C and D and\\\\ndepletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 7.2).\\\\nThis leads to a decrease in the rate of forward\\\\nreaction and an increase in he rate of the\\\\nreverse reaction,\\\\n\\\\nFig. 7.2 Attainment of chemical equilibrium.\\\\nEventually, the two reactions occur at the\\\\nsame rate and the system reaches a state of\\\\nequilibrium.\\\\nSimilarly, the reaction can reach the state of\\\\nequilibrium even if we start with only C and D;\\\\nthat is, no A and B being present initially, as the\\\\nequilibrium can be reached from either direction.\\\\nThe dynamic nature of chemical\\\\nequilibrium can be demonstrated in the\\\\nsynthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process. In\\\\na series of experiments, Haber started with\\\\nknown amounts of dinitrogen and dihydrogen\\\\nmaintained at high temperature and pressure\\\\nand at regular intervals determined the\\\\namount of ammonia present. He was\\\\nsuccessful in determining also the\\\\nconcentration of unreacted dihydrogen and\\\\ndinitrogen. Fig. 7.4 (page 191) shows that after\\\\na certain time the composition of the mixture\\\\nremains the same even though some of the\\\\nreactants are still present. This constancy in\\\\ncomposition indicates that the reaction has\\\\nreached equilibrium. In order to understand\\\\nthe dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis\\\\nof ammonia is carried out with exactly the\\\\nsame starting conditions (of partial pressure\\\\nand temperature) but using D 2 (deuterium)\\\\nin place of H 2. The reaction mixtures starting\\\\neither with H 2 or D 2 reach equilibrium with\\\\nthe same composition, except that D 2 and ND 3\\\\nare present instead of H 2 and NH 3. After\\\\nequilibrium is attained, these two mixtures\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 197\\\\n\\\\nDynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity\\\\nEquilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic\\\\nnature. This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible\\\\nin a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing\\\\nthe following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.\\\\nTake two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes\\\\neach of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of\\\\n3-5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this\\\\npurpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder\\\\n(number 2) empty.\\\\nPut one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder\\\\n1, close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its\\\\nlower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured\\\\nwater in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring\\\\ncoloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you\\\\nnotice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant.\\\\nIf you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will\\\\nnot be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take\\\\nanalogy of ‘level’ of coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the\\\\ntwo cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy\\\\nof level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking\\\\ntwo tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in\\\\ntwo cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two\\\\ncylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning.\\\\nFig.7.3 Demonstrating dynamic nature of equilibrium.

If we start with equal\\\\ninitial concentration of H 2 and I 2 , the reaction\\\\nproceeds in the forward direction and the\\\\nconcentration of H 2 and I 2 decreases while that\\\\nof HI increases, until all of these become\\\\nconstant at equilibrium (Fig. 7.5). We can also\\\\nstart with HI alone and make the reaction to\\\\nproceed in the reverse direction; the\\\\nconcentration of HI will decrease and\\\\nconcentration of H 2 and I 2 will increase until\\\\nthey all become constant when equilibrium is\\\\nreached (Fig.7.5). If total number of H and I\\\\natoms are same in a given volume, the same\\\\nequilibrium mixture is obtained whether we\\\\nstart it from pure reactants or pure product.\\\\n(H 2 , N 2 , NH 3 and D 2 , N 2 , ND 3 ) are mixed\\\\ntogether and left for a while. Later, when this\\\\nmixture is analysed, it is found that the\\\\nconcentration of ammonia is just the same as\\\\nbefore. However, when this mixture is\\\\nanalysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found\\\\nthat ammonia and all deuterium containing\\\\nforms of ammonia (NH 3 , NH 2 D, NHD 2 and ND 3 )\\\\nand dihydrogen and its deutrated forms\\\\n(H 2 , HD and D 2 ) are present. Thus one can\\\\nconclude that scrambling of H and D atoms\\\\nin the molecules must result from a\\\\ncontinuation of the forward and reverse\\\\nreactions in the mixture. If the reaction had\\\\nsimply stopped when they reached\\\\nequilibrium, then there would have been no\\\\nmixing of isotopes in this way.\\\\n\\\\nUse of isotope (deuterium) in the formation\\\\nof ammonia clearly indicates that chemical\\\\nreactions reach a state of dynamic\\\\nequilibrium in which the rates of forward\\\\nand reverse reactions are equal and there\\\\nis no net change in composition.\\\\n\\\\nEquilibrium can be attained from both\\\\nsides, whether we start reaction by taking,\\\\nH 2 (g) and N 2 (g) and get NH 3 (g) or by taking\\\\nNH 3 (g) and decomposing it into N 2 (g) and\\\\nH 2 (g).\\\\n\\\\nN 2 (g) + 3H 2 (g) 2NH 3 (g)\\\\nFig 7.4 Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction\\\\nFig.7.5 Chemical equilibrium in the reaction\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g)  2HI(g) can be attained\\\\nfrom either direction\\\\n\\\\n7.3 Law of Chemical Equilibrium and Equilibrium Constant\\\\n\\\\nA mixture of reactants and products in the\\\\nequilibrium state is called an equilibrium\\\\nmixture.

On the basis of experimental studies\\\\nof many reversible reactions, the Norwegian\\\\nchemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and Peter\\\\nWaage proposed in 1864 that the\\\\nconcentrations in an equilibrium mixture are\\\\nrelated by the following equilibrium\\\\nequation,\\\\nKc =[ ][ ]\\\\n[ ][ ]\\\\n\\\\nC D\\\\n\\\\nA B\\\\n\\\\n(7.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant\\\\nand the expression on the right side is called\\\\nthe equilibrium constant expression.\\\\nThe equilibrium equation is also known as\\\\nthe law of mass action because in the early\\\\ndays of chemistry, concentration was called\\\\n“active mass”.

Expression for equilibrium constant is\\\\n    applicable only when concentrations of the\\\\n    reactants and products have attained\\\\n    constant value at equilibrium state.\\\\n2. The value of equilibrium constant is\\\\n    independent of initial concentrations of the\\\\n    reactants and products.\\\\n3. Equilibrium constant is temperature\\\\n    dependent having one unique value for a\\\\n    particular reaction represented by a\\\\n    balanced equation at a given temperature.\\\\n4. The equilibrium constant for the reverse\\\\n    reaction is equal to the inverse of the\\\\n    equilibrium constant for the forward\\\\n    reaction.\\\\n\\\\n206 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n(a) The decomposition of H 2 O into H 2 and O 2\\\\nat 500 K has a very small equilibrium\\\\nconstant, Kc = 4.1 × 1 0 –^48\\\\n\\\\n(b)N 2 (g) + O 2 (g) 2NO(g),\\\\nat 298 K has Kc = 4.8 ×1 0 –31.\\\\n\\\\nIf Kc is in the range of 1 0 –3 to 10^3 ,\\\\n    appreciable concentrations of both\\\\n    reactants and products are present.\\\\n    Consider the following examples:\\\\n\\\\n(a) For reaction of H 2 with I 2 to give HI,\\\\n\\\\nKc = 57.0 at 700K.\\\\n(b)Also, gas phase decomposition of N 2 O 4 to\\\\nNO 2 is another reaction with a value\\\\nof Kc = 4.64 × 1 0 –3 at 25°C which is neither\\\\ntoo small nor too large. Hence,\\\\nequilibrium mixtures contain appreciable\\\\nconcentrations of both N 2 O 4 and NO 2.\\\\nThese generarlisations are illustrated in\\\\nFig. 7.6\\\\n\\\\nIf Qc = Kc , the reaction mixture is already\\\\nat equilibrium.\\\\nConsider the gaseous reaction of H 2\\\\nwith I 2 ,\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g) 2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.\\\\nSuppose we have molar concentrations\\\\n[H 2 ]t=0.10M, [I 2 ]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.\\\\n(the subscript t on the concentration symbols\\\\nmeans that the concentrations were measured\\\\nat some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at\\\\nequilibrium).\\\\nThus, the reaction quotient, Qc at this stage\\\\nof the reaction is given by,\\\\nQc = [HI]t^2 / [H 2 ]t [I 2 ]t = (0.40)^2 / (0.10)×(0.20)\\\\n= 8.0\\\\nNow, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal\\\\nKc (57.0), so the mixture of H 2 (g), I 2 (g) and HI(g)\\\\nis not at equilibrium; that is, more H 2 (g) and\\\\nI 2 (g) will react to form more HI(g) and their\\\\nconcentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.\\\\nThe reaction quotient, Qc is useful in\\\\npredicting the direction of reaction by\\\\ncomparing the values of Qc and Kc.\\\\nThus, we can make the following\\\\ngeneralisations concerning the direction of the\\\\nFig.7.6 Dependence of extent of reaction on K reaction (Fig. 7.7) :\\\\nc\\\\n7.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the\\\\nReaction\\\\n\\\\na A + b B c C + d D (7.19)\\\\n\\\\nQc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b^ (7.20)\\\\n\\\\nThen,\\\\nIf Qc > Kc , the reaction will proceed in the\\\\ndirection of reactants (reverse reaction).\\\\nIf Qc < Kc , the reaction will proceed in the\\\\ndirection of the products (forward reaction).\\\\n\\\\nProblem 7.7\\\\nThe value of Kc for the reaction\\\\n2A B + C is 2 × 10–3.

This implies maximum yield of\\\\nproducts at mild temperature and pressure\\\\nconditions. If it does not happen, then the\\\\nexperimental conditions need to be adjusted.\\\\nFor example, in the Haber process for the\\\\nsynthesis of ammonia from N 2 and H 2 , the\\\\nchoice of experimental conditions is of real\\\\neconomic importance. Annual world\\\\nproduction of ammonia is about hundred\\\\nmillion tones, primarily for use as fertilizers.\\\\nEquilibrium constant, Kc is independent of\\\\ninitial concentrations. But if a system at\\\\nequilibrium is subjected to a change in the\\\\nconcentration of one or more of the reacting\\\\nsubstances, then the system is no longer at\\\\nequilibrium; and net reaction takes place in\\\\nsome direction until the system returns to\\\\nequilibrium once again. Similarly, a change in\\\\ntemperature or pressure of the system may\\\\nalso alter the equilibrium. In order to decide\\\\nwhat course the reaction adopts and make a\\\\nqualitative prediction about the effect of a\\\\nchange in conditions on equilibrium we use\\\\nLe Chatelier’s principle. It states that a\\\\nchange in any of the factors that\\\\ndetermine the equilibrium conditions of a\\\\nsystem will cause the system to change\\\\nin such a manner so as to reduce or to\\\\ncounteract the effect of the change. This\\\\nis applicable to all physical and chemical\\\\nequilibria.\\\\nWe shall now be discussing factors which\\\\ncan influence the equilibrium.\\\\n7.8.1 Effect of Concentration Change\\\\nIn general, when equilibrium is disturbed by\\\\nthe addition/removal of any reactant/\\\\nproducts, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that:\\\\n- The concentration stress of an added\\\\n    reactant/product is relieved by net reaction\\\\n    in the direction that consumes the added\\\\n    substance.\\\\n- The concentration stress of a removed\\\\n    reactant/product is relieved by net reaction\\\\n    in the direction that replenishes the\\\\n    removed substance.\\\\n    or in other words,\\\\n\\\\n“ When the concentration of any of the\\\\nreactants or products in a reaction at\\\\nequilibrium is changed, the composition\\\\nof the equilibrium mixture changes so as\\\\nto minimize the effect of concentration\\\\nchanges”.\\\\nLet us take the reaction,\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g) 2HI(g)\\\\nIf H 2 is added to the reaction mixture at\\\\nequilibrium, then the equilibrium of the\\\\nreaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, the\\\\nreaction proceeds in a direction wherein H 2 is\\\\nconsumed, i.e., more of H 2 and I 2 react to form\\\\nHI and finally the equilibrium shifts in right\\\\n(forward) direction (Fig.7.8). This is in\\\\naccordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle\\\\nwhich implies that in case of addition of a\\\\nreactant/product, a new equilibrium will be\\\\nset up in which the concentration of the\\\\nreactant/product should be less than what it\\\\nwas after the addition but more than what it\\\\nwas in the original mixture.\\\\nThe same point can be explained in terms\\\\nof the reaction quotient, Qc ,\\\\nQc = [HI]^2 / [H 2 ][I 2 ]\\\\n\\\\n210 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nAddition of hydrogen at equilibrium results\\\\nin value of Q c being less than Kc. Thus, in order\\\\nto attain equilibrium again reaction moves in\\\\nthe forward direction. Similarly, we can say\\\\nthat removal of a product also boosts the\\\\nforward reaction and increases the\\\\nconcentration of the products and this has\\\\ngreat commercial application in cases of\\\\nreactions, where the product is a gas or a\\\\nvolatile substance. In case of manufacture of\\\\nammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed\\\\nfrom the reaction mixture so that reaction\\\\nkeeps moving in forward direction. Similarly,\\\\nin the large scale production of CaO (used as\\\\nimportant building material) from CaCO 3 ,\\\\nconstant removal of CO 2 from the kiln drives\\\\nthe reaction to completion. It should be\\\\nremembered that continuous removal of a\\\\nproduct maintains Qc at a value less than Kc\\\\nand reaction continues to move in the forward\\\\ndirection.\\\\n\\\\nEffect of Concentration – An experiment\\\\n\\\\nThis can be demonstrated by the following\\\\nreaction:\\\\n\\\\nFe3+(aq)+ SCN–(aq) [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq) (7.24)\\\\n\\\\nyellow colourless deep red\\\\n\\\\n(7.25)\\\\n\\\\nA reddish colour appears on adding two\\\\ndrops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate\\\\nsolution to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate\\\\nsolution due to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+.\\\\nThe intensity of the red colour becomes\\\\nconstant on attaining equilibrium. This\\\\nequilibrium can be shifted in either forward\\\\nor reverse directions depending on our choice\\\\nof adding a reactant or a product. The\\\\nequilibrium can be shifted in the opposite\\\\ndirection by adding reagents that remove Fe3+\\\\nor SCN– ions. For example, oxalic acid\\\\n(H 2 C 2 O 4 ), reacts with Fe3+ ions to form the\\\\nstable complex ion [Fe(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ]3–, thus\\\\ndecreasing the concentration of free Fe3+(aq).\\\\nIn accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle,\\\\nthe concentration stress of removed Fe3+ is\\\\nrelieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ to\\\\n\\\\nreplenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the\\\\nconcentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the\\\\nintensity of red colour decreases.\\\\nAddition of aq. HgCl 2 also decreases red\\\\ncolour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to\\\\nform stable complex ion [Hg(SCN) 4 ]2–. Removal\\\\nof free SCN– (aq) shifts the equilibrium in\\\\nequation (7.24) from right to left to replenish\\\\nSCN– ions. Addition of potassium thiocyanate\\\\non the other hand increases the colour\\\\nintensity of the solution as it shift the\\\\nequilibrium to right.\\\\n7.8.2 Effect of Pressure Change\\\\nA pressure change obtained by changing the\\\\nvolume can affect the yield of products in case\\\\nof a gaseous reaction where the total number\\\\nof moles of gaseous reactants and total\\\\nnumber of moles of gaseous products are\\\\ndifferent. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle\\\\nto a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect of\\\\npressure changes on solids and liquids can\\\\nbe ignored because the volume (and\\\\nconcentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly\\\\nindependent of pressure.\\\\nConsider the reaction,\\\\nCO(g) + 3H 2 (g) CH 4 (g) + H 2 O(g)\\\\nHere, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H 2 )\\\\nbecome 2 mol of gaseous products (CH 4 +\\\\nH 2 O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above\\\\nreaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston\\\\nat constant temperature is compressed to one\\\\nhalf of its original volume. Then, total pressure\\\\nwill be doubled (according to\\\\npV = constant). The partial pressure and\\\\ntherefore, concentration of reactants and\\\\nproducts have changed and the mixture is no\\\\nlonger at equilibrium. The direction in which\\\\nthe reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium\\\\ncan be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s\\\\nprinciple. Since pressure has doubled, the\\\\nequilibrium now shifts in the forward\\\\ndirection, a direction in which the number of\\\\nmoles of the gas or pressure decreases (we\\\\nknow pressure is proportional to moles of the\\\\ngas). This can also be understood by using\\\\nreaction quotient, Q c. Let [CO], [H 2 ], [CH 4 ] and\\\\n[H 2 O] be the molar concentrations at\\\\nequilibrium for methanation reaction. When\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 211\\\\nFig. 7.9Effect of temperature on equilibrium for\\\\nthe reaction, 2NO 2 (g) N 2 O 4 (g)\\\\nvolume of the reaction mixture is halved, the\\\\npartial pressure and the concentration are\\\\ndoubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by\\\\nreplacing each equilibrium concentration by\\\\ndouble its value.\\\\nQc =\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n2CO(g), when\\\\npressure is increased, the reaction goes in the\\\\nreverse direction because the number of moles\\\\nof gas increases in the forward direction.\\\\n7.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas Addition\\\\nIf the volume is kept constant and an inert gas\\\\nsuch as argon is added which does not take\\\\npart in the reaction, the equilibrium remains\\\\nundisturbed. It is because the addition of an\\\\ninert gas at constant volume does not change\\\\nthe partial pressures or the molar\\\\nconcentrations of the substance involved in the\\\\nreaction. The reaction quotient changes only\\\\nif the added gas is a reactant or product\\\\ninvolved in the reaction.\\\\n7.8.4 Effect of Temperature Change\\\\nWhenever an equilibrium is disturbed by a\\\\nchange in the concentration, pressure or\\\\nvolume, the composition of the equilibrium\\\\nmixture changes because the reaction\\\\nquotient, Q c no longer equals the equilibrium\\\\nconstant, K c. However, when a change in\\\\ntemperature occurs, the value of equilibrium\\\\nconstant, Kc is changed.\\\\nIn general, the temperature dependence of\\\\nthe equilibrium constant depends on the sign\\\\nof ∆ H for the reaction.\\\\n- The equilibrium constant for an exothermic\\\\n    reaction (negative ∆ H ) decreases as the\\\\n    temperature increases.\\\\n- The equilibrium constant for an\\\\n    endothermic reaction (positive ∆ H )\\\\n    increases as the temperature increases.\\\\n    Temperature changes affect the\\\\nequilibrium constant and rates of reactions.\\\\n\\\\nProduction of ammonia according to the\\\\nreaction,\\\\nN 2 (g) + 3H 2 (g) 2NH 3 (g) ;\\\\n∆ H = – 92.38 kJ mol–^1\\\\nis an exothermic process. According to\\\\nLe Chatelier’s principle, raising the\\\\ntemperature shifts the equilibrium to left and\\\\ndecreases the equilibrium concentration of\\\\nammonia. In other words, low temperature is\\\\nfavourable for high yield of ammonia, but\\\\npractically very low temperatures slow down\\\\nthe reaction and thus a catalyst is used.\\\\nEffect of Temperature – An experiment\\\\nEffect of temperature on equilibrium can be\\\\ndemonstrated by taking NO 2 gas (brown in\\\\ncolour) which dimerises into N 2 O 4 gas\\\\n(colourless).\\\\n2NO 2 (g) N 2 O 4 (g); ∆ H = –57.2 kJ mol–1\\\\nNO 2 gas prepared by addition of Cu\\\\nturnings to conc. HNO 3 is collected in two\\\\n5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity of\\\\ncolour of gas in each tube) and stopper sealed\\\\nwith araldite. Three 250 mL beakers 1, 2 and\\\\n3 containing freezing mixture, water at room\\\\ntemperature and hot water (363K),\\\\nrespectively, are taken (Fig. 7.9). Both the test\\\\ntubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes.\\\\nAfter this one is placed in beaker 1 and the\\\\nother in beaker 3. The effect of temperature\\\\non direction of reaction is depicted very well\\\\nin this experiment. At low temperatures in\\\\nbeaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of\\\\nN 2 O 4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, and\\\\nthus, intensity of brown colour due to NO 2\\\\ndecreases. While in beaker 3, high\\\\ntemperature favours the reverse reaction of\\\\n\\\\n212 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nformation of NO 2 and thus, the brown colour\\\\nintensifies.\\\\n\\\\nEffect of temperature can also be seen in\\\\nan endothermic reaction,\\\\n\\\\n[Co(H 2 O) 6 ]3+(aq) + 4Cl–(aq) [CoCl 4 ]2–(aq) +\\\\n6H 2 O(l)\\\\npink colourless blue\\\\nAt room temperature, the equilibrium\\\\nmixture is blue due to [CoCl 4 ]2–. When cooled\\\\nin a freezing mixture, the colour of the mixture\\\\nturns pink due to [Co(H 2 O) 6 ]3+.\\\\n\\\\n7.8.5 Effect of a Catalyst\\\\n\\\\nA catalyst increases the rate of the chemical\\\\nreaction by making available a new low energy\\\\npathway for the conversion of reactants to\\\\nproducts. It increases the rate of forward and\\\\nreverse reactions that pass through the same\\\\ntransition state and does not affect\\\\nequilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation\\\\nenergy for the forward and reverse reactions\\\\nby exactly the same amount. Catalyst does not\\\\naffect the equilibrium composition of a\\\\nreaction mixture. It does not appear in the\\\\nbalanced chemical equation or in the\\\\nequilibrium constant expression.\\\\n\\\\nLet us consider the formation of NH 3 from\\\\ndinitrogen and dihydrogen which is highly\\\\nexothermic reaction and proceeds with\\\\ndecrease in total number of moles formed as\\\\ncompared to the reactants. Equilibrium\\\\nconstant decreases with increase', '×1 0 –31.\\\\n\\\\nIf Kc is in the range of 1 0 –3 to 10^3 ,\\\\n    appreciable concentrations of both\\\\n    reactants and products are present.\\\\n    Consider the following examples:\\\\n\\\\n(a) For reaction of H 2 with I 2 to give HI,\\\\n\\\\nKc = 57.0 at 700K.\\\\n(b)Also, gas phase decomposition of N 2 O 4 to\\\\nNO 2 is another reaction with a value\\\\nof Kc = 4.64 × 1 0 –3 at 25°C which is neither\\\\ntoo small nor too large. Hence,\\\\nequilibrium mixtures contain appreciable\\\\nconcentrations of both N 2 O 4 and NO 2.\\\\nThese generarlisations are illustrated in\\\\nFig. 7.6\\\\n\\\\nIf Qc = Kc , the reaction mixture is already\\\\nat equilibrium.\\\\nConsider the gaseous reaction of H 2\\\\nwith I 2 ,\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g) 2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.\\\\nSuppose we have molar concentrations\\\\n[H 2 ]t=0.10M, [I 2 ]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.\\\\n(the subscript t on the concentration symbols\\\\nmeans that the concentrations were measured\\\\nat some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at\\\\nequilibrium).\\\\nThus, the reaction quotient, Qc at this stage\\\\nof the reaction is given by,\\\\nQc = [HI]t^2 / [H 2 ]t [I 2 ]t = (0.40)^2 / (0.10)×(0.20)\\\\n= 8.0\\\\nNow, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal\\\\nKc (57.0), so the mixture of H 2 (g), I 2 (g) and HI(g)\\\\nis not at equilibrium; that is, more H 2 (g) and\\\\nI 2 (g) will react to form more HI(g) and their\\\\nconcentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.\\\\nThe reaction quotient, Qc is useful in\\\\npredicting the direction of reaction by\\\\ncomparing the values of Qc and Kc.\\\\nThus, we can make the following\\\\ngeneralisations concerning the direction of the\\\\nFig.7.6 Dependence of extent of reaction on K reaction (Fig. 7.7) :\\\\nc\\\\n7.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the\\\\nReaction\\\\n\\\\na A + b B c C + d D (7.19)\\\\n\\\\nQc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b^ (7.20)\\\\n\\\\nThen,\\\\nIf Qc > Kc , the reaction will proceed in the\\\\ndirection of reactants (reverse reaction).\\\\nIf Qc < Kc , the reaction will proceed in the\\\\ndirection of the products (forward reaction).\\\\n\\\\nProblem 7.7\\\\nThe value of Kc for the reaction\\\\n2A B + C is 2 × 10–3.

It states that a\\\\nchange in any of the factors that\\\\ndetermine the equilibrium conditions of a\\\\nsystem will cause the system to change\\\\nin such a manner so as to reduce or to\\\\ncounteract the effect of the change. This\\\\nis applicable to all physical and chemical\\\\nequilibria.\\\\nWe shall now be discussing factors which\\\\ncan influence the equilibrium.\\\\n7.8.1 Effect of Concentration Change\\\\nIn general, when equilibrium is disturbed by\\\\nthe addition/removal of any reactant/\\\\nproducts, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that:\\\\n- The concentration stress of an added\\\\n    reactant/product is relieved by net reaction\\\\n    in the direction that consumes the added\\\\n    substance.\\\\n- The concentration stress of a removed\\\\n    reactant/product is relieved by net reaction\\\\n    in the direction that replenishes the\\\\n    removed substance.\\\\n    or in other words,\\\\n\\\\n“ When the concentration of any of the\\\\nreactants or products in a reaction at\\\\nequilibrium is changed, the composition\\\\nof the equilibrium mixture changes so as\\\\nto minimize the effect of concentration\\\\nchanges”.\\\\nLet us take the reaction,\\\\nH 2 (g) + I 2 (g) 2HI(g)\\\\nIf H 2 is added to the reaction mixture at\\\\nequilibrium, then the equilibrium of the\\\\nreaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, the\\\\nreaction proceeds in a direction wherein H 2 is\\\\nconsumed, i.e., more of H 2 and I 2 react to form\\\\nHI and finally the equilibrium shifts in right\\\\n(forward) direction (Fig.7.8). This is in\\\\naccordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle\\\\nwhich implies that in case of addition of a\\\\nreactant/product, a new equilibrium will be\\\\nset up in which the concentration of the\\\\nreactant/product should be less than what it\\\\nwas after the addition but more than what it\\\\nwas in the original mixture.\\\\nThe same point can be explained in terms\\\\nof the reaction quotient, Qc ,\\\\nQc = [HI]^2 / [H 2 ][I 2 ]\\\\n\\\\n210 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nAddition of hydrogen at equilibrium results\\\\nin value of Q c being less than Kc. Thus, in order\\\\nto attain equilibrium again reaction moves in\\\\nthe forward direction. Similarly, we can say\\\\nthat removal of a product also boosts the\\\\nforward reaction and increases the\\\\nconcentration of the products and this has\\\\ngreat commercial application in cases of\\\\nreactions, where the product is a gas or a\\\\nvolatile substance. In case of manufacture of\\\\nammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed\\\\nfrom the reaction mixture so that reaction\\\\nkeeps moving in forward direction. Similarly,\\\\nin the large scale production of CaO (used as\\\\nimportant building material) from CaCO 3 ,\\\\nconstant removal of CO 2 from the kiln drives\\\\nthe reaction to completion. It should be\\\\nremembered that continuous removal of a\\\\nproduct maintains Qc at a value less than Kc\\\\nand reaction continues to move in the forward\\\\ndirection.\\\\n\\\\nEffect of Concentration – An experiment\\\\n\\\\nThis can be demonstrated by the following\\\\nreaction:\\\\n\\\\nFe3+(aq)+ SCN–(aq) [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq) (7.24)\\\\n\\\\nyellow colourless deep red\\\\n\\\\n(7.25)\\\\n\\\\nA reddish colour appears on adding two\\\\ndrops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate\\\\nsolution to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate\\\\nsolution due to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+.\\\\nThe intensity of the red colour becomes\\\\nconstant on attaining equilibrium. This\\\\nequilibrium can be shifted in either forward\\\\nor reverse directions depending on our choice\\\\nof adding a reactant or a product. The\\\\nequilibrium can be shifted in the opposite\\\\ndirection by adding reagents that remove Fe3+\\\\nor SCN– ions. For example, oxalic acid\\\\n(H 2 C 2 O 4 ), reacts with Fe3+ ions to form the\\\\nstable complex ion [Fe(C 2 O 4 ) 3 ]3–, thus\\\\ndecreasing the concentration of free Fe3+(aq).\\\\nIn accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle,\\\\nthe concentration stress of removed Fe3+ is\\\\nrelieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ to\\\\n\\\\nreplenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the\\\\nconcentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the\\\\nintensity of red colour decreases.\\\\nAddition of aq. HgCl 2 also decreases red\\\\ncolour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to\\\\nform stable complex ion [Hg(SCN) 4 ]2–. Removal\\\\nof free SCN– (aq) shifts the equilibrium in\\\\nequation (7.24) from right to left to replenish\\\\nSCN– ions. Addition of potassium thiocyanate\\\\non the other hand increases the colour\\\\nintensity of the solution as it shift the\\\\nequilibrium to right.\\\\n7.8.2 Effect of Pressure Change\\\\nA pressure change obtained by changing the\\\\nvolume can affect the yield of products in case\\\\nof a gaseous reaction where the total number\\\\nof moles of gaseous reactants and total\\\\nnumber of moles of gaseous products are\\\\ndifferent. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle\\\\nto a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect of\\\\npressure changes on solids and liquids can\\\\nbe ignored because the volume (and\\\\nconcentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly\\\\nindependent of pressure.\\\\nConsider the reaction,\\\\nCO(g) + 3H 2 (g) CH 4 (g) + H 2 O(g)\\\\nHere, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H 2 )\\\\nbecome 2 mol of gaseous products (CH 4 +\\\\nH 2 O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above\\\\nreaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston\\\\nat constant temperature is compressed to one\\\\nhalf of its original volume. Then, total pressure\\\\nwill be doubled (according to\\\\npV = constant). The partial pressure and\\\\ntherefore, concentration of reactants and\\\\nproducts have changed and the mixture is no\\\\nlonger at equilibrium. The direction in which\\\\nthe reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium\\\\ncan be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s\\\\nprinciple. Since pressure has doubled, the\\\\nequilibrium now shifts in the forward\\\\ndirection, a direction in which the number of\\\\nmoles of the gas or pressure decreases (we\\\\nknow pressure is proportional to moles of the\\\\ngas). This can also be understood by using\\\\nreaction quotient, Q c. Let [CO], [H 2 ], [CH 4 ] and\\\\n[H 2 O] be the molar concentrations at\\\\nequilibrium for methanation reaction. When\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 211\\\\nFig. 7.9Effect of temperature on equilibrium for\\\\nthe reaction, 2NO 2 (g) N 2 O 4 (g)\\\\nvolume of the reaction mixture is halved, the\\\\npartial pressure and the concentration are\\\\ndoubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by\\\\nreplacing each equilibrium concentration by\\\\ndouble its value.\\\\nQc =\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 ( )\\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n2CO(g), when\\\\npressure is increased, the reaction goes in the\\\\nreverse direction because the number of moles\\\\nof gas increases in the forward direction.\\\\n7.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas Addition\\\\nIf the volume is kept constant and an inert gas\\\\nsuch as argon is added which does not take\\\\npart in the reaction, the equilibrium remains\\\\nundisturbed. It is because the addition of an\\\\ninert gas at constant volume does not change\\\\nthe partial pressures or the molar\\\\nconcentrations of the substance involved in the\\\\nreaction. The reaction quotient changes only\\\\nif the added gas is a reactant or product\\\\ninvolved in the reaction.\\\\n7.8.4 Effect of Temperature Change\\\\nWhenever an equilibrium is disturbed by a\\\\nchange in the concentration, pressure or\\\\nvolume, the composition of the equilibrium\\\\nmixture changes because the reaction\\\\nquotient, Q c no longer equals the equilibrium\\\\nconstant, K c. However, when a change in\\\\ntemperature occurs, the value of equilibrium\\\\nconstant, Kc is changed.\\\\nIn general, the temperature dependence of\\\\nthe equilibrium constant depends on the sign\\\\nof ∆ H for the reaction.\\\\n- The equilibrium constant for an exothermic\\\\n    reaction (negative ∆ H ) decreases as the\\\\n    temperature increases.\\\\n- The equilibrium constant for an\\\\n    endothermic reaction (positive ∆ H )\\\\n    increases as the temperature increases.\\\\n    Temperature changes affect the\\\\nequilibrium constant and rates of reactions.\\\\n\\\\nProduction of ammonia according to the\\\\nreaction,\\\\nN 2 (g) + 3H 2 (g) 2NH 3 (g) ;\\\\n∆ H = – 92.38 kJ mol–^1\\\\nis an exothermic process. According to\\\\nLe Chatelier’s principle, raising the\\\\ntemperature shifts the equilibrium to left and\\\\ndecreases the equilibrium concentration of\\\\nammonia. In other words, low temperature is\\\\nfavourable for high yield of ammonia, but\\\\npractically very low temperatures slow down\\\\nthe reaction and thus a catalyst is used.\\\\nEffect of Temperature – An experiment\\\\nEffect of temperature on equilibrium can be\\\\ndemonstrated by taking NO 2 gas (brown in\\\\ncolour) which dimerises into N 2 O 4 gas\\\\n(colourless).\\\\n2NO 2 (g) N 2 O 4 (g); ∆ H = –57.2 kJ mol–1\\\\nNO 2 gas prepared by addition of Cu\\\\nturnings to conc. HNO 3 is collected in two\\\\n5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity of\\\\ncolour of gas in each tube) and stopper sealed\\\\nwith araldite. Three 250 mL beakers 1, 2 and\\\\n3 containing freezing mixture, water at room\\\\ntemperature and hot water (363K),\\\\nrespectively, are taken (Fig. 7.9). Both the test\\\\ntubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes.\\\\nAfter this one is placed in beaker 1 and the\\\\nother in beaker 3. The effect of temperature\\\\non direction of reaction is depicted very well\\\\nin this experiment. At low temperatures in\\\\nbeaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of\\\\nN 2 O 4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, and\\\\nthus, intensity of brown colour due to NO 2\\\\ndecreases. While in beaker 3, high\\\\ntemperature favours the reverse reaction of\\\\n\\\\n212 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nformation of NO 2 and thus, the brown colour\\\\nintensifies.\\\\n\\\\nEffect of temperature can also be seen in\\\\nan endothermic reaction,\\\\n\\\\n[Co(H 2 O) 6 ]3+(aq) + 4Cl–(aq) [CoCl 4 ]2–(aq) +\\\\n6H 2 O(l)\\\\npink colourless blue\\\\nAt room temperature, the equilibrium\\\\nmixture is blue due to [CoCl 4 ]2–. When cooled\\\\nin a freezing mixture, the colour of the mixture\\\\nturns pink due to [Co(H 2 O) 6 ]3+.\\\\n\\\\n7.8.5 Effect of a Catalyst\\\\n\\\\nA catalyst increases the rate of the chemical\\\\nreaction by making available a new low energy\\\\npathway for the conversion of reactants to\\\\nproducts. It increases the rate of forward and\\\\nreverse reactions that pass through the same\\\\ntransition state and does not affect\\\\nequilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation\\\\nenergy for the forward and reverse reactions\\\\nby exactly the same amount. Catalyst does not\\\\naffect the equilibrium composition of a\\\\nreaction mixture. It does not appear in the\\\\nbalanced chemical equation or in the\\\\nequilibrium constant expression.\\\\n\\\\nLet us consider the formation of NH 3 from\\\\ndinitrogen and dihydrogen which is highly\\\\nexothermic reaction and proceeds with\\\\ndecrease in total number of moles formed as\\\\ncompared to the reactants. Equilibrium\\\\nconstant decreases with increase in\\\\ntemperature. At low temperature rate\\\\ndecreases and it takes long time to reach at\\\\nequilibrium, whereas high temperatures give\\\\nsatisfactory rates but poor yields.\\\\n\\\\nGerman chemist, Fritz Haber discovered\\\\nthat a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse the\\\\nreaction to occur at a satisfactory rate at\\\\ntemperatures, where the equilibrium\\\\nconcentration of NH 3 is reasonably favourable.\\\\nSince the number of moles formed in the\\\\nreaction is less than those of reactants, the\\\\nyield of NH 3 can be improved by increasing\\\\nthe pressure.\\\\n\\\\nOptimum conditions of temperature and\\\\npressure for the synthesis of NH 3 using\\\\ncatalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in manufacture of sulphuric\\\\nacid by contact process ,\\\\n2SO 2 (g) + O 2 (g) 2SO 3 (g); Kc = 1.7 × 10^26\\\\nthough the value of K is suggestive of reaction\\\\ngoing to completion, but practically the oxidation\\\\nof SO 2 to SO 3 is very slow. Thus, platinum or\\\\ndivanadium penta-oxide (V 2 O 5 ) is used as\\\\ncatalyst to increase the rate of the reaction.\\\\nNote: If a reaction has an exceedingly small\\\\nK , a catalyst would be of little help.\\\\n\\\\n7.9 Ionic Equilibrium in Solution\\\\n\\\\nUnder the effect of change of concentration on\\\\nthe direction of equilibrium, you have\\\\nincidently come across with the following\\\\nequilibrium which involves ions:\\\\nFe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq) [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)\\\\nThere are numerous equilibria that involve\\\\nions only. In the following sections we will\\\\nstudy the equilibria involving ions. It is well\\\\nknown that the aqueous solution of sugar\\\\ndoes not conduct electricity. However, when\\\\ncommon salt (sodium chloride) is added to\\\\nwater it conducts electricity. Also, the\\\\nconductance of electricity increases with an\\\\nincrease in concentration of common salt.\\\\nMichael Faraday classified the substances into\\\\ntwo categories based on their ability to conduct\\\\nelectricity. One category of substances\\\\nconduct electricity in their aqueous solutions\\\\nand are called electrolytes while the other do\\\\nnot and are thus, referred to as non-\\\\nelectrolytes. Faraday further classified\\\\nelectrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes.\\\\nStrong electrolytes on dissolution in water are\\\\nionized almost completely, while the weak\\\\nelectrolytes are only partially dissociated.\\\\nFor example, an aqueous solution of\\\\nsodium chloride is comprised entirely of\\\\nsodium ions and chloride ions, while that\\\\nof acetic acid mainly contains unionized\\\\nacetic acid molecules and only some acetate\\\\nions and hydronium ions. This is because\\\\nthere is almost 100% ionization in case of\\\\nsodium chloride as compared to less\\\\nthan 5% ionization of acetic acid which is\\\\na weak electrolyte. It should be noted\\\\nthat in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 213\\\\n\\\\nFig.7.10 Dissolution of sodium chloride in water.\\\\nNa+ and Cl– ions are stablised by their\\\\nhydration with polar water molecules.\\\\nestablished between ions and the unionized\\\\nmolecules. This type of equilibrium involving\\\\nions in aqueous solution is called ionic\\\\nequilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come\\\\nunder the category of electrolytes and may act\\\\nas either strong or weak electrolytes.\\\\n\\\\n7.10Acids, Bases and Salts\\\\n\\\\nAcids, bases and salts find widespread\\\\noccurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid\\\\npresent in the gastric juice is secreted by the\\\\nlining of our stomach in a significant amount\\\\nof 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive\\\\nprocesses. Acetic acid is known to be the main\\\\nconstituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange\\\\njuices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and\\\\ntartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As\\\\nmost of the acids taste sour, the word “acid”\\\\nhas been derived from a latin word “ acidus”\\\\nmeaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue\\\\nlitmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen\\\\non reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases\\\\nare known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste\\\\nbitter and feel soapy. A common example of a\\\\nbase is washing soda used for washing\\\\npurposes. When acids and bases are mixed in\\\\nthe right proportion they react with each other\\\\nto give salts. Some commonly known\\\\nexamples of salts are sodium chloride, barium\\\\nsulphate, sodium nitrate. Sodium chloride\\\\n(common salt ) is an important component of\\\\nour diet and is formed by reaction between\\\\nhydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It\\\\nexists in solid state as a cluster of positively\\\\ncharged sodium ions and negatively charged\\\\nchloride ions which are held together due to\\\\nelectrostatic interactions between oppositely\\\\ncharged species (Fig.7.10). The electrostatic\\\\nforces between two charges are inversely\\\\nproportional to dielectric constant of the\\\\nmedium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses\\\\na very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus,\\\\nwhen sodium chloride is dissolved in water,\\\\nthe electrostatic interactions are reduced by a\\\\nfactor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to move\\\\nfreely in the solution. Also, they are well-\\\\nseparated due to hydration with water\\\\nmolecules.\\\\nFaraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of 14 he\\\\nwas an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the books he\\\\nwas binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant to Davy, and\\\\nduring 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent. During this trip he gained\\\\nmuch from the experience of coming into contact with many of the leading scientists of\\\\nthe time. In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal Institution laboratories,\\\\nand in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. Faraday’s first\\\\nimportant work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821 much of his work was on\\\\nelectricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic phenomena. His ideas have led to the establishment\\\\nof modern field theory. He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest\\\\nand kind hearted person. He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to\\\\nwork alone and never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his\\\\nFriday evening discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution. He has been very famous for his\\\\nChristmas lecture on the ‘Chemical History of a Candle’. He published nearly 450 scientific papers.\\\\nMichael Faraday\\\\n(1791–1867)\\\\nComparing, the ionization of hydrochloric\\\\nacid with that of acetic acid in water we find\\\\nthat though both of them are polar covalent\\\\n\\\\n214 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nmolecules, former is completely ionized into\\\\nits constituent ions, while the latter is only\\\\npartially ionized (< 5%). The extent to which\\\\nionization occurs depends upon the strength\\\\nof the bond and the extent of solvation of ions\\\\nproduced. The terms dissociation and\\\\nionization have earlier been used with different\\\\nmeaning. Dissociation refers to the process of\\\\nseparation of ions in water already existing as\\\\nsuch in the solid state of the solute, as in\\\\nsodium chloride. On the other hand, ionization\\\\ncorresponds to a process in which a neutral\\\\nmolecule splits into charged ions in the\\\\nsolution. Here, we shall not distinguish\\\\nbetween the two and use the two terms\\\\ninterchangeably.\\\\n\\\\n7.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and\\\\nBases\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Arrhenius theory, acids are\\\\nsubstances that dissociates in water to give\\\\nhydrogen ions H + (aq) and bases are\\\\nsubstances that produce hydroxyl ions\\\\nOH–(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can\\\\nbe represented by the following equations:\\\\n\\\\nHX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)\\\\nor\\\\nHX(aq) + H 2 O(l) → H 3 O+(aq) + X –(aq)\\\\nA bare proton, H+ is very reactive and\\\\ncannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. Thus,\\\\nit bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent water\\\\nmolecule to give trigonal pyramidal\\\\nhydronium ion, H 3 O+ {[H (H 2 O)]+} (see box).\\\\nIn this chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H 3 O+(aq)\\\\ninterchangeably to mean the same i.e., a\\\\nhydrated proton.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a base molecule like MOH\\\\nionizes in aqueous solution according to the\\\\nequation:\\\\n\\\\nMOH(aq) → M+(aq) + OH–(aq)\\\\nThe hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated\\\\nform in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius\\\\nconcept of acid and base, however, suffers\\\\nfrom the limitation of being applicable only to\\\\naqueous solutions and also, does not account\\\\nfor the basicity of substances like, ammonia\\\\nwhich do not possess a hydroxyl group.\\\\n\\\\n7.10.2 The Brönsted-Lowry Acids and\\\\nBases\\\\nThe Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and\\\\nthe English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave a\\\\nmore general definition of acids and bases.\\\\nAccording to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid is\\\\na substance that is capable of donating a\\\\nhydrogen ion H+ and bases are substances\\\\ncapable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H +. In\\\\nshort, acids are proton donors and bases are\\\\nproton acceptors.\\\\nConsider the example of dissolution of NH 3\\\\nin H 2 O represented by the following equation:\\\\nHydronium and Hydroxyl Ions\\\\nHydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with\\\\nvery small size (~10–15 m radius) and\\\\nintense electric field, binds itself with the\\\\nwater molecule at one of the two available\\\\nlone pairs on it giving H 3 O+. This species\\\\nhas been detected in many compounds\\\\n(e.g., H 3 O+Cl–) in the solid state. In aqueous\\\\nsolution the hydronium ion is further\\\\nhydrated to give species like H 5 O 2 +, H 7 O 3 + and\\\\nH 9 O 4 +. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated\\\\nto give several ionic species like H 3 O 2 – , H 5 O 3 –\\\\nand H 7 O 4 – etc.\\\\nThe basic solution is formed due to the\\\\npresence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction,\\\\nwater molecule acts as proton donor and\\\\nammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor\\\\nand are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and\\\\nH 9 O 4 +\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 215\\\\n\\\\nSvante Arrhenius\\\\n(1859-1927)\\\\nArrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the conductivities\\\\nof electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884. For the next five years he\\\\ntravelled extensively and visited a number of research centers in Europe. In 1895 he was\\\\nappointed professor of physics at the newly formed University of Stockholm, serving its\\\\nrector from 1897 to 1902. From 1905 until his death he was Director of physical chemistry\\\\nat the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. He continued to work for many years on electrolytic\\\\nsolutions. In 1899 he discussed the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the\\\\nbasis of an equation, now usually known as Arrhenius equation.\\\\nHe worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to\\\\nimmunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was the\\\\nfirst to discuss the ‘green house effect’ calling by that name. He received Nobel Prize in\\\\nChemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in the development\\\\nof chemistry.\\\\nbase, respectively. In the reverse reaction, H+\\\\nis transferred from NH 4 + to OH–. In this case,\\\\nNH 4 + acts as a Bronsted acid while OH– acted\\\\nas a Brönsted base. The acid-base pair that\\\\ndiffers only by one proton is called a conjugate\\\\nacid-base pair. Therefore, OH– is called the\\\\nconjugate base of an acid H 2 O and NH 4 + is\\\\ncalled conjugate acid of the base NH 3. If\\\\nBrönsted acid is a strong acid then its\\\\nconjugate base is a weak base and vice-\\\\nversa. It may be noted that conjugate acid\\\\nhas one extra proton and each conjugate base\\\\nhas one less proton.\\\\nConsider the example of ionization of\\\\nhydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as an\\\\nacid by donating a proton to H 2 O molecule\\\\nwhich acts as a base.\\\\nammonia it acts as an acid by donating a\\\\nproton.\\\\nProblem 7.12\\\\nWhat will be the conjugate bases for the\\\\nfollowing Brönsted acids: HF, H 2 SO 4 and\\\\nHCO 3 –^?\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe conjugate bases should have one\\\\nproton less in each case and therefore the\\\\ncorresponding conjugate bases are: F–,\\\\nHSO 4 – and CO 3 2– respectively.\\\\nProblem 7.13\\\\nWrite the conjugate acids for the following\\\\nBrönsted bases: NH 2\\\\n-\\\\n    , NH 3 and HCOO–.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe conjugate acid should have one extra\\\\nproton in each case and therefore the\\\\ncorresponding conjugate acids are: NH 3 ,\\\\nNH 4 + and HCOOH respectively.\\\\nProblem 7.14\\\\nThe species: H 2 O, HCO 3\\\\n-\\\\n, HSO 4\\\\n-\\\\nand NH 3\\\\ncan act both as Bronsted acids and bases.\\\\nFor each case give the corresponding\\\\nconjugate acid and conjugate base.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe answer is given in the following Table:\\\\nSpecies Conjugate Conjugate\\\\nacid base\\\\nH 2 O H 3 O+ OH\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nHCO 3 – H 2 CO 3 CO 3 2–\\\\nHSO 4 – H 2 SO 4 SO 4 2–\\\\nNH 3 NH 4 + NH 2 –\\\\nIt can be seen in the above equation, that\\\\nwater acts as a base because it accepts the\\\\nproton. The species H 3 O+ is produced when\\\\nwater accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore,\\\\nCl– is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the\\\\nconjugate acid of base Cl–. Similarly, H 2 O is a\\\\nconjugate base of an acid H 3 O+ and H 3 O+ is a\\\\nconjugate acid of base H 2 O.\\\\nIt is interesting to observe the dual role of\\\\nwater as an acid and a base. In case of reaction\\\\nwith HCl water acts as a base while in case of\\\\n\\\\n216 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n7.10.3 Lewis Acids and Bases\\\\n\\\\nG.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as a\\\\nspecies which accepts electron pair and base\\\\nwhich donates an electron pair. As far as\\\\nbases are concerned, there is not much\\\\ndifference between Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis\\\\nconcepts, as the base provides a lone pair in\\\\nboth the cases. However, in Lewis concept\\\\nmany acids do not have proton. A typical\\\\nexample is reaction of electron deficient species\\\\nBF 3 with NH 3.\\\\n\\\\nBF 3 does not have a proton but still acts\\\\nas an acid and reacts with NH 3 by accepting\\\\nits lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be\\\\nrepresented by,\\\\n\\\\nBF 3 + :NH 3 → BF 3 :NH 3\\\\nElectron deficient species like AlCl 3 , Co3+,\\\\nMg2+, etc. can act as Lewis acids while species\\\\nlike H 2 O, NH 3 , OH– etc. which can donate a pair\\\\nof electrons, can act as Lewis bases.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 7.15\\\\nClassify the following species into Lewis\\\\nacids and Lewis bases and show how\\\\nthese act as such:\\\\n(a) HO– (b)F– (c) H+ (d) BCl 3\\\\nSolution\\\\n(a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can\\\\ndonate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).\\\\n(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base as\\\\nit can donate any one of its four\\\\nelectron lone pairs.\\\\n(c) A proton is a Lewis acid as it can\\\\naccept a lone pair of electrons from\\\\nbases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride\\\\nion.\\\\n(d) BCl 3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can\\\\naccept a lone pair of electrons from\\\\nspecies like ammonia or amine\\\\nmolecules.\\\\n\\\\n7.11Ionization of Acids and Bases\\\\n\\\\nArrhenius concept of acids and bases becomes\\\\nuseful in case of ionization of acids and bases\\\\nas mostly ionizations in chemical and\\\\nbiological systems occur in aqueous medium.\\\\nStrong acids like perchloric acid (HClO 4 ),\\\\n\\\\nhydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid\\\\n(HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO 3 )\\\\nand sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) are termed strong\\\\nbecause they are almost completely\\\\ndissociated into their constituent ions in an\\\\naqueous medium, thereby acting as proton\\\\n(H+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like\\\\nlithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide\\\\n(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium\\\\nhydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide\\\\nBa(OH) 2 are almost completely dissociated into\\\\nions in an aqueous medium giving hydroxyl\\\\nions, OH–. According to Arrhenius concept\\\\nthey are strong acids and bases as they are\\\\nable to completely dissociate and produce H 3 O+\\\\nand OH\\\\n-\\\\n    ions respectively in the medium.\\\\nAlternatively, the strength of an acid or base\\\\nmay also be gauged in terms of Brönsted-\\\\nLowry concept of acids and bases, wherein a\\\\nstrong acid means a good proton donor and a\\\\nstrong base implies a good proton acceptor.\\\\nConsider, the acid-base dissociation\\\\nequilibrium of a weak acid HA,\\\\nHA(aq) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + A–(aq)\\\\nconjugate conjugate\\\\nacid base acid base\\\\nIn section 7.10.2 we saw that acid (or base)\\\\ndissociation equilibrium is dynamic involving\\\\na transfer of proton in forward and reverse\\\\ndirections. Now, the question arises that if the\\\\nequilibrium is dynamic then with passage of\\\\ntime which direction is favoured? What is the\\\\ndriving force behind it? In order to answer\\\\nthese questions we shall deal into the issue of\\\\ncomparing the strengths of the two acids (or\\\\nbases) involved in the dissociation equilibrium.\\\\nConsider the two acids HA and H 3 O+ present\\\\nin the above mentioned acid-dissociation\\\\nequilibrium. We have to see which amongst\\\\nthem is a stronger proton donor. Whichever\\\\nexceeds in its tendency of donating a proton\\\\nover the other shall be termed as the stronger\\\\nacid and the equilibrium will shift in the\\\\ndirection of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a\\\\nstronger acid than H 3 O+, then HA will donate\\\\nprotons and not H 3 O+, and the solution will\\\\nmainly contain A–^ and H 3 O+ ions. The\\\\nequilibrium moves in the direction of\\\\nformation of weaker acid and weaker base\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 217\\\\n\\\\nbecause the stronger acid donates a proton\\\\nto the stronger base.\\\\nIt follows that as a strong acid dissociates\\\\ncompletely in water, the resulting base formed\\\\nwould be very weak i.e., strong acids have\\\\nvery weak conjugate bases. Strong acids like\\\\nperchloric acid (HClO 4 ), hydrochloric acid\\\\n(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid\\\\n(HI), nitric acid (HNO 3 ) and sulphuric acid\\\\n(H 2 SO 4 ) will give conjugate base ions ClO 4 – , Cl,\\\\nBr–, I–, NO 3 – and HSO 4 – , which are much weaker\\\\nbases than H 2 O. Similarly a very strong base\\\\nwould give a very weak conjugate acid. On the\\\\nother hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially\\\\ndissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the\\\\nsolution mainly contains undissociated HA\\\\nmolecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous', 'increase in\\\\ntemperature. At low temperature rate\\\\ndecreases and it takes long time to reach at\\\\nequilibrium, whereas high temperatures give\\\\nsatisfactory rates but poor yields.\\\\n\\\\nGerman chemist, Fritz Haber discovered\\\\nthat a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse the\\\\nreaction to occur at a satisfactory rate at\\\\ntemperatures, where the equilibrium\\\\nconcentration of NH 3 is reasonably favourable.\\\\nSince the number of moles formed in the\\\\nreaction is less than those of reactants, the\\\\nyield of NH 3 can be improved by increasing\\\\nthe pressure.\\\\n\\\\nOptimum conditions of temperature and\\\\npressure for the synthesis of NH 3 using\\\\ncatalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in manufacture of sulphuric\\\\nacid by contact process ,\\\\n2SO 2 (g) + O 2 (g) 2SO 3 (g); Kc = 1.7 × 10^26\\\\nthough the value of K is suggestive of reaction\\\\ngoing to completion, but practically the oxidation\\\\nof SO 2 to SO 3 is very slow. Thus, platinum or\\\\ndivanadium penta-oxide (V 2 O 5 ) is used as\\\\ncatalyst to increase the rate of the reaction.\\\\nNote: If a reaction has an exceedingly small\\\\nK , a catalyst would be of little help.\\\\n\\\\n7.9 Ionic Equilibrium in Solution\\\\n\\\\nUnder the effect of change of concentration on\\\\nthe direction of equilibrium, you have\\\\nincidently come across with the following\\\\nequilibrium which involves ions:\\\\nFe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq) [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)\\\\nThere are numerous equilibria that involve\\\\nions only. In the following sections we will\\\\nstudy the equilibria involving ions. It is well\\\\nknown that the aqueous solution of sugar\\\\ndoes not conduct electricity. However, when\\\\ncommon salt (sodium chloride) is added to\\\\nwater it conducts electricity. Also, the\\\\nconductance of electricity increases with an\\\\nincrease in concentration of common salt.\\\\nMichael Faraday classified the substances into\\\\ntwo categories based on their ability to conduct\\\\nelectricity. One category of substances\\\\nconduct electricity in their aqueous solutions\\\\nand are called electrolytes while the other do\\\\nnot and are thus, referred to as non-\\\\nelectrolytes. Faraday further classified\\\\nelectrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes.\\\\nStrong electrolytes on dissolution in water are\\\\nionized almost completely, while the weak\\\\nelectrolytes are only partially dissociated.\\\\nFor example, an aqueous solution of\\\\nsodium chloride is comprised entirely of\\\\nsodium ions and chloride ions, while that\\\\nof acetic acid mainly contains unionized\\\\nacetic acid molecules and only some acetate\\\\nions and hydronium ions. This is because\\\\nthere is almost 100% ionization in case of\\\\nsodium chloride as compared to less\\\\nthan 5% ionization of acetic acid which is\\\\na weak electrolyte. It should be noted\\\\nthat in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 213\\\\n\\\\nFig.7.10 Dissolution of sodium chloride in water.\\\\nNa+ and Cl– ions are stablised by their\\\\nhydration with polar water molecules.\\\\nestablished between ions and the unionized\\\\nmolecules. This type of equilibrium involving\\\\nions in aqueous solution is called ionic\\\\nequilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come\\\\nunder the category of electrolytes and may act\\\\nas either strong or weak electrolytes.\\\\n\\\\n7.10Acids, Bases and Salts\\\\n\\\\nAcids, bases and salts find widespread\\\\noccurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid\\\\npresent in the gastric juice is secreted by the\\\\nlining of our stomach in a significant amount\\\\nof 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive\\\\nprocesses. Acetic acid is known to be the main\\\\nconstituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange\\\\njuices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and\\\\ntartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As\\\\nmost of the acids taste sour, the word “acid”\\\\nhas been derived from a latin word “ acidus”\\\\nmeaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue\\\\nlitmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen\\\\non reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases\\\\nare known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste\\\\nbitter and feel soapy. A common example of a\\\\nbase is washing soda used for washing\\\\npurposes. When acids and bases are mixed in\\\\nthe right proportion they react with each other\\\\nto give salts. Some commonly known\\\\nexamples of salts are sodium chloride, barium\\\\nsulphate, sodium nitrate. Sodium chloride\\\\n(common salt ) is an important component of\\\\nour diet and is formed by reaction between\\\\nhydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It\\\\nexists in solid state as a cluster of positively\\\\ncharged sodium ions and negatively charged\\\\nchloride ions which are held together due to\\\\nelectrostatic interactions between oppositely\\\\ncharged species (Fig.7.10). The electrostatic\\\\nforces between two charges are inversely\\\\nproportional to dielectric constant of the\\\\nmedium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses\\\\na very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus,\\\\nwhen sodium chloride is dissolved in water,\\\\nthe electrostatic interactions are reduced by a\\\\nfactor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to move\\\\nfreely in the solution. Also, they are well-\\\\nseparated due to hydration with water\\\\nmolecules.\\\\nFaraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of 14 he\\\\nwas an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the books he\\\\nwas binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant to Davy, and\\\\nduring 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent. During this trip he gained\\\\nmuch from the experience of coming into contact with many of the leading scientists of\\\\nthe time. In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal Institution laboratories,\\\\nand in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. Faraday’s first\\\\nimportant work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821 much of his work was on\\\\nelectricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic phenomena. His ideas have led to the establishment\\\\nof modern field theory. He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest\\\\nand kind hearted person. He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to\\\\nwork alone and never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his\\\\nFriday evening discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution. He has been very famous for his\\\\nChristmas lecture on the ‘Chemical History of a Candle’. He published nearly 450 scientific papers.\\\\nMichael Faraday\\\\n(1791–1867)\\\\nComparing, the ionization of hydrochloric\\\\nacid with that of acetic acid in water we find\\\\nthat though both of them are polar covalent\\\\n\\\\n214 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nmolecules, former is completely ionized into\\\\nits constituent ions, while the latter is only\\\\npartially ionized (< 5%). The extent to which\\\\nionization occurs depends upon the strength\\\\nof the bond and the extent of solvation of ions\\\\nproduced. The terms dissociation and\\\\nionization have earlier been used with different\\\\nmeaning. Dissociation refers to the process of\\\\nseparation of ions in water already existing as\\\\nsuch in the solid state of the solute, as in\\\\nsodium chloride. On the other hand, ionization\\\\ncorresponds to a process in which a neutral\\\\nmolecule splits into charged ions in the\\\\nsolution. Here, we shall not distinguish\\\\nbetween the two and use the two terms\\\\ninterchangeably.\\\\n\\\\n7.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and\\\\nBases\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Arrhenius theory, acids are\\\\nsubstances that dissociates in water to give\\\\nhydrogen ions H + (aq) and bases are\\\\nsubstances that produce hydroxyl ions\\\\nOH–(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can\\\\nbe represented by the following equations:\\\\n\\\\nHX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)\\\\nor\\\\nHX(aq) + H 2 O(l) → H 3 O+(aq) + X –(aq)\\\\nA bare proton, H+ is very reactive and\\\\ncannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. Thus,\\\\nit bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent water\\\\nmolecule to give trigonal pyramidal\\\\nhydronium ion, H 3 O+ {[H (H 2 O)]+} (see box).\\\\nIn this chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H 3 O+(aq)\\\\ninterchangeably to mean the same i.e., a\\\\nhydrated proton.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, a base molecule like MOH\\\\nionizes in aqueous solution according to the\\\\nequation:\\\\n\\\\nMOH(aq) → M+(aq) + OH–(aq)\\\\nThe hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated\\\\nform in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius\\\\nconcept of acid and base, however, suffers\\\\nfrom the limitation of being applicable only to\\\\naqueous solutions and also, does not account\\\\nfor the basicity of substances like, ammonia\\\\nwhich do not possess a hydroxyl group.\\\\n\\\\n7.10.2 The Brönsted-Lowry Acids and\\\\nBases\\\\nThe Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and\\\\nthe English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave a\\\\nmore general definition of acids and bases.\\\\nAccording to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid is\\\\na substance that is capable of donating a\\\\nhydrogen ion H+ and bases are substances\\\\ncapable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H +. In\\\\nshort, acids are proton donors and bases are\\\\nproton acceptors.\\\\nConsider the example of dissolution of NH 3\\\\nin H 2 O represented by the following equation:\\\\nHydronium and Hydroxyl Ions\\\\nHydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with\\\\nvery small size (~10–15 m radius) and\\\\nintense electric field, binds itself with the\\\\nwater molecule at one of the two available\\\\nlone pairs on it giving H 3 O+. This species\\\\nhas been detected in many compounds\\\\n(e.g., H 3 O+Cl–) in the solid state. In aqueous\\\\nsolution the hydronium ion is further\\\\nhydrated to give species like H 5 O 2 +, H 7 O 3 + and\\\\nH 9 O 4 +. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated\\\\nto give several ionic species like H 3 O 2 – , H 5 O 3 –\\\\nand H 7 O 4 – etc.\\\\nThe basic solution is formed due to the\\\\npresence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction,\\\\nwater molecule acts as proton donor and\\\\nammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor\\\\nand are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and\\\\nH 9 O 4 +\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 215\\\\n\\\\nSvante Arrhenius\\\\n(1859-1927)\\\\nArrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the conductivities\\\\nof electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884. For the next five years he\\\\ntravelled extensively and visited a number of research centers in Europe. In 1895 he was\\\\nappointed professor of physics at the newly formed University of Stockholm, serving its\\\\nrector from 1897 to 1902. From 1905 until his death he was Director of physical chemistry\\\\nat the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. He continued to work for many years on electrolytic\\\\nsolutions. In 1899 he discussed the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the\\\\nbasis of an equation, now usually known as Arrhenius equation.\\\\nHe worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to\\\\nimmunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was the\\\\nfirst to discuss the ‘green house effect’ calling by that name. He received Nobel Prize in\\\\nChemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in the development\\\\nof chemistry.\\\\nbase, respectively. In the reverse reaction, H+\\\\nis transferred from NH 4 + to OH–. In this case,\\\\nNH 4 + acts as a Bronsted acid while OH– acted\\\\nas a Brönsted base. The acid-base pair that\\\\ndiffers only by one proton is called a conjugate\\\\nacid-base pair. Therefore, OH– is called the\\\\nconjugate base of an acid H 2 O and NH 4 + is\\\\ncalled conjugate acid of the base NH 3. If\\\\nBrönsted acid is a strong acid then its\\\\nconjugate base is a weak base and vice-\\\\nversa. It may be noted that conjugate acid\\\\nhas one extra proton and each conjugate base\\\\nhas one less proton.\\\\nConsider the example of ionization of\\\\nhydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as an\\\\nacid by donating a proton to H 2 O molecule\\\\nwhich acts as a base.\\\\nammonia it acts as an acid by donating a\\\\nproton.\\\\nProblem 7.12\\\\nWhat will be the conjugate bases for the\\\\nfollowing Brönsted acids: HF, H 2 SO 4 and\\\\nHCO 3 –^?\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe conjugate bases should have one\\\\nproton less in each case and therefore the\\\\ncorresponding conjugate bases are: F–,\\\\nHSO 4 – and CO 3 2– respectively.\\\\nProblem 7.13\\\\nWrite the conjugate acids for the following\\\\nBrönsted bases: NH 2\\\\n-\\\\n    , NH 3 and HCOO–.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe conjugate acid should have one extra\\\\nproton in each case and therefore the\\\\ncorresponding conjugate acids are: NH 3 ,\\\\nNH 4 + and HCOOH respectively.\\\\nProblem 7.14\\\\nThe species: H 2 O, HCO 3\\\\n-\\\\n, HSO 4\\\\n-\\\\nand NH 3\\\\ncan act both as Bronsted acids and bases.\\\\nFor each case give the corresponding\\\\nconjugate acid and conjugate base.\\\\nSolution\\\\nThe answer is given in the following Table:\\\\nSpecies Conjugate Conjugate\\\\nacid base\\\\nH 2 O H 3 O+ OH\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nHCO 3 – H 2 CO 3 CO 3 2–\\\\nHSO 4 – H 2 SO 4 SO 4 2–\\\\nNH 3 NH 4 + NH 2 –\\\\nIt can be seen in the above equation, that\\\\nwater acts as a base because it accepts the\\\\nproton. The species H 3 O+ is produced when\\\\nwater accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore,\\\\nCl– is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the\\\\nconjugate acid of base Cl–. Similarly, H 2 O is a\\\\nconjugate base of an acid H 3 O+ and H 3 O+ is a\\\\nconjugate acid of base H 2 O.\\\\nIt is interesting to observe the dual role of\\\\nwater as an acid and a base. In case of reaction\\\\nwith HCl water acts as a base while in case of\\\\n\\\\n216 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\n7.10.3 Lewis Acids and Bases\\\\n\\\\nG.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as a\\\\nspecies which accepts electron pair and base\\\\nwhich donates an electron pair. As far as\\\\nbases are concerned, there is not much\\\\ndifference between Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis\\\\nconcepts, as the base provides a lone pair in\\\\nboth the cases. However, in Lewis concept\\\\nmany acids do not have proton. A typical\\\\nexample is reaction of electron deficient species\\\\nBF 3 with NH 3.\\\\n\\\\nBF 3 does not have a proton but still acts\\\\nas an acid and reacts with NH 3 by accepting\\\\nits lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be\\\\nrepresented by,\\\\n\\\\nBF 3 + :NH 3 → BF 3 :NH 3\\\\nElectron deficient species like AlCl 3 , Co3+,\\\\nMg2+, etc. can act as Lewis acids while species\\\\nlike H 2 O, NH 3 , OH– etc. which can donate a pair\\\\nof electrons, can act as Lewis bases.\\\\n\\\\nProblem 7.15\\\\nClassify the following species into Lewis\\\\nacids and Lewis bases and show how\\\\nthese act as such:\\\\n(a) HO– (b)F– (c) H+ (d) BCl 3\\\\nSolution\\\\n(a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can\\\\ndonate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).\\\\n(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base as\\\\nit can donate any one of its four\\\\nelectron lone pairs.\\\\n(c) A proton is a Lewis acid as it can\\\\naccept a lone pair of electrons from\\\\nbases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride\\\\nion.\\\\n(d) BCl 3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can\\\\naccept a lone pair of electrons from\\\\nspecies like ammonia or amine\\\\nmolecules.\\\\n\\\\n7.11Ionization of Acids and Bases\\\\n\\\\nArrhenius concept of acids and bases becomes\\\\nuseful in case of ionization of acids and bases\\\\nas mostly ionizations in chemical and\\\\nbiological systems occur in aqueous medium.\\\\nStrong acids like perchloric acid (HClO 4 ),\\\\n\\\\nhydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid\\\\n(HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid (HNO 3 )\\\\nand sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) are termed strong\\\\nbecause they are almost completely\\\\ndissociated into their constituent ions in an\\\\naqueous medium, thereby acting as proton\\\\n(H+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like\\\\nlithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide\\\\n(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium\\\\nhydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide\\\\nBa(OH) 2 are almost completely dissociated into\\\\nions in an aqueous medium giving hydroxyl\\\\nions, OH–. According to Arrhenius concept\\\\nthey are strong acids and bases as they are\\\\nable to completely dissociate and produce H 3 O+\\\\nand OH\\\\n-\\\\n    ions respectively in the medium.\\\\nAlternatively, the strength of an acid or base\\\\nmay also be gauged in terms of Brönsted-\\\\nLowry concept of acids and bases, wherein a\\\\nstrong acid means a good proton donor and a\\\\nstrong base implies a good proton acceptor.\\\\nConsider, the acid-base dissociation\\\\nequilibrium of a weak acid HA,\\\\nHA(aq) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + A–(aq)\\\\nconjugate conjugate\\\\nacid base acid base\\\\nIn section 7.10.2 we saw that acid (or base)\\\\ndissociation equilibrium is dynamic involving\\\\na transfer of proton in forward and reverse\\\\ndirections. Now, the question arises that if the\\\\nequilibrium is dynamic then with passage of\\\\ntime which direction is favoured? What is the\\\\ndriving force behind it? In order to answer\\\\nthese questions we shall deal into the issue of\\\\ncomparing the strengths of the two acids (or\\\\nbases) involved in the dissociation equilibrium.\\\\nConsider the two acids HA and H 3 O+ present\\\\nin the above mentioned acid-dissociation\\\\nequilibrium. We have to see which amongst\\\\nthem is a stronger proton donor. Whichever\\\\nexceeds in its tendency of donating a proton\\\\nover the other shall be termed as the stronger\\\\nacid and the equilibrium will shift in the\\\\ndirection of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a\\\\nstronger acid than H 3 O+, then HA will donate\\\\nprotons and not H 3 O+, and the solution will\\\\nmainly contain A–^ and H 3 O+ ions. The\\\\nequilibrium moves in the direction of\\\\nformation of weaker acid and weaker base\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 217\\\\n\\\\nbecause the stronger acid donates a proton\\\\nto the stronger base.\\\\nIt follows that as a strong acid dissociates\\\\ncompletely in water, the resulting base formed\\\\nwould be very weak i.e., strong acids have\\\\nvery weak conjugate bases. Strong acids like\\\\nperchloric acid (HClO 4 ), hydrochloric acid\\\\n(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid\\\\n(HI), nitric acid (HNO 3 ) and sulphuric acid\\\\n(H 2 SO 4 ) will give conjugate base ions ClO 4 – , Cl,\\\\nBr–, I–, NO 3 – and HSO 4 – , which are much weaker\\\\nbases than H 2 O. Similarly a very strong base\\\\nwould give a very weak conjugate acid. On the\\\\nother hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially\\\\ndissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the\\\\nsolution mainly contains undissociated HA\\\\nmolecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous acid\\\\n(HNO 2 ), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic acid\\\\n(CH 3 COOH). It should be noted that the weak\\\\nacids have very strong conjugate bases. For\\\\nexample, NH 2 – , O\\\\n2–\\\\nand H– are very good proton\\\\nacceptors and thus, much stronger bases than\\\\nH 2 O.\\\\nCertain water soluble organic compounds\\\\nlike phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue\\\\nbehave as weak acids and exhibit different\\\\ncolours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base\\\\n(In– ) forms.\\\\nHIn(aq) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + In–(aq)\\\\nacid conjugate conjugate\\\\nindicator acid base\\\\ncolour A colourB\\\\nSuch compounds are useful as indicators\\\\nin acid-base titrations, and finding out H+ ion\\\\nconcentration.\\\\n7.11.1 The Ionization Constant of Water\\\\nand its Ionic Product\\\\nSome substances like water are unique in their\\\\nability of acting both as an acid and a base.\\\\nWe have seen this in case of water in section\\\\n7.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it accepts a\\\\nproton and acts as the base while in the\\\\npresence of a base, B– it acts as an acid by\\\\ndonating a proton. In pure water, one H 2 O\\\\nmolecule donates proton and acts as an acid\\\\nand another water molecules accepts a proton\\\\nand acts as a base at the same time. The\\\\nfollowing equilibrium exists:\\\\nH 2 O(l) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + OH–(aq)\\\\nacid base conjugate conjugate\\\\nacid base\\\\nThe dissociation constant is represented by,\\\\nK = [H 3 O+] [OH–] / [H 2 O] (7.26)\\\\nThe concentration of water is omitted from\\\\nthe denominator as water is a pure liquid and\\\\nits concentration remains constant. [H 2 O] is\\\\nincorporated within the equilibrium constant\\\\nto give a new constant, K w, which is called the\\\\nionic product of water.\\\\nK w = [H+][OH–] (7.27)\\\\nThe concentration of H+ has been found\\\\nout experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K.\\\\nAnd, as dissociation of water produces equal\\\\nnumber of H+ and OH– ions, the concentration\\\\nof hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 1 0 –7 M.\\\\nThus, the value of K w at 298K,\\\\nK w = [H 3 O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)^2 = 1 × 10–14 M^2\\\\n(7.28)\\\\nThe value of K w is temperature dependent\\\\nas it is an equilibrium constant.\\\\nThe density of pure water is 1000 g / L\\\\nand its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this\\\\nthe molarity of pure water can be given as,\\\\n[H 2 O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M.\\\\nTherefore, the ratio of dissociated water to that\\\\nof undissociated water can be given as:\\\\n10 –7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 1 0 –9 or^ ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus,\\\\nequilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated\\\\nwater)\\\\nWe can distinguish acidic, neutral and\\\\nbasic aqueous solutions by the relative values\\\\nof the H 3 O+ and OH– concentrations:\\\\nAcidic: [H 3 O+] > [OH– ]\\\\nNeutral: [H 3 O+] = [OH\\\\n-\\\\n    ]\\\\nBasic : [H 3 O+] < [OH\\\\n-\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n7.11.2 The pH Scale\\\\nHydronium ion concentration in molarity is\\\\nmore conveniently expressed on a logarithmic\\\\nscale known as the pH scale. The pH of a\\\\nsolution is defined as the negative logarithm\\\\nto base 10 of the activity (aH+) of hydrogen\\\\n\\\\n218 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity of\\\\nhydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude to\\\\nmolarity represented by [H+]. It should\\\\nbe noted that activity has no units and is\\\\ndefined as:\\\\n\\\\na\\\\n= [H+] / mol L–1\\\\nFrom the definition of pH, the following\\\\ncan be written,\\\\n\\\\npH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}\\\\nThus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M)\\\\nwill have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution\\\\nof NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H 3 O+] =\\\\n10 –10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure\\\\nwater has a concentration of hydrogen ions,\\\\n[H+] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is\\\\ngiven as:\\\\n\\\\npH = –log(10–7) = 7\\\\nAcidic solutions possess a concentration\\\\nof hydrogen ions, [H+] > 10–7 M, while basic\\\\nsolutions possess a concentration of hydrogen\\\\nions, [H+] < 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise\\\\nthat\\\\nAcidic solution has pH < 7\\\\nBasic solution has pH > 7\\\\nNeutral solution has pH = 7\\\\nNow again, consider the equation (7.28) at\\\\n298 K\\\\nK w = [H 3 O+] [OH–] = 10–14\\\\nTaking negative logarithm on both sides\\\\nof equation, we obtain\\\\n\\\\n–log K w = – log {[H 3 O+] [OH\\\\n-\\\\n    ]}\\\\n= – log [H 3 O+] – log [OH–]\\\\n= – log 1 0 –14\\\\np K w = pH + pOH = 14 (7.29)\\\\nNote that although K w may change with\\\\ntemperature the variations in pH with\\\\ntemperature are so small that we often\\\\nignore it.\\\\n\\\\np K w is a very important quantity for\\\\naqueous solutions and controls the relative\\\\nconcentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions\\\\nas their product is a constant. It should be\\\\nnoted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, a\\\\n\\\\nchange in pH by just one unit also means\\\\nchange in [H+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when\\\\nthe hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] changes\\\\nby a factor of 100, the value of pH changes by\\\\n2 units. Now you can realise why the change\\\\nin pH with temperature is often ignored.\\\\nMeasurement of pH of a solution is very\\\\nessential as its value should be known when\\\\ndealing with biological and cosmetic\\\\napplications. The pH of a solution can be found\\\\nroughly with the help of pH paper that has\\\\ndifferent colour in solutions of different pH.\\\\nNow-a-days pH paper is available with four\\\\nstrips on it. The different strips have different\\\\ncolours (Fig. 7.11) at the same pH. The pH in\\\\nthe range of 1-14 can be determined with an\\\\naccuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper.\\\\nFig.7.11 pH -paper with four strips that may\\\\nhave different colours at the same pH\\\\nFor greater accuracy pH meters are used.\\\\npH meter is a device that measures the\\\\npH-dependent electrical potential of the test\\\\nsolution within 0.001 precision. pH meters of\\\\nthe size of a writing pen are now available in\\\\nthe market.

In presence of an acid, HA it accepts a\\\\nproton and acts as the base while in the\\\\npresence of a base, B– it acts as an acid by\\\\ndonating a proton. In pure water, one H 2 O\\\\nmolecule donates proton and acts as an acid\\\\nand another water molecules accepts a proton\\\\nand acts as a base at the same time. The\\\\nfollowing equilibrium exists:\\\\nH 2 O(l) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + OH–(aq)\\\\nacid base conjugate conjugate\\\\nacid base\\\\nThe dissociation constant is represented by,\\\\nK = [H 3 O+] [OH–] / [H 2 O] (7.26)\\\\nThe concentration of water is omitted from\\\\nthe denominator as water is a pure liquid and\\\\nits concentration remains constant. [H 2 O] is\\\\nincorporated within the equilibrium constant\\\\nto give a new constant, K w, which is called the\\\\nionic product of water.\\\\nK w = [H+][OH–] (7.27)\\\\nThe concentration of H+ has been found\\\\nout experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K.\\\\nAnd, as dissociation of water produces equal\\\\nnumber of H+ and OH– ions, the concentration\\\\nof hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 1 0 –7 M.\\\\nThus, the value of K w at 298K,\\\\nK w = [H 3 O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)^2 = 1 × 10–14 M^2\\\\n(7.28)\\\\nThe value of K w is temperature dependent\\\\nas it is an equilibrium constant.\\\\nThe density of pure water is 1000 g / L\\\\nand its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this\\\\nthe molarity of pure water can be given as,\\\\n[H 2 O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M.\\\\nTherefore, the ratio of dissociated water to that\\\\nof undissociated water can be given as:\\\\n10 –7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 1 0 –9 or^ ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus,\\\\nequilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated\\\\nwater)\\\\nWe can distinguish acidic, neutral and\\\\nbasic aqueous solutions by the relative values\\\\nof the H 3 O+ and OH– concentrations:\\\\nAcidic: [H 3 O+] > [OH– ]\\\\nNeutral: [H 3 O+] = [OH\\\\n-\\\\n    ]\\\\nBasic : [H 3 O+] < [OH\\\\n-\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n7.11.2 The pH Scale\\\\nHydronium ion concentration in molarity is\\\\nmore conveniently expressed on a logarithmic\\\\nscale known as the pH scale. The pH of a\\\\nsolution is defined as the negative logarithm\\\\nto base 10 of the activity (aH+) of hydrogen\\\\n\\\\n218 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity of\\\\nhydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude to\\\\nmolarity represented by [H+]. It should\\\\nbe noted that activity has no units and is\\\\ndefined as:\\\\n\\\\na\\\\n= [H+] / mol L–1\\\\nFrom the definition of pH, the following\\\\ncan be written,\\\\n\\\\npH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}\\\\nThus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M)\\\\nwill have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution\\\\nof NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H 3 O+] =\\\\n10 –10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure\\\\nwater has a concentration of hydrogen ions,\\\\n[H+] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is\\\\ngiven as:\\\\n\\\\npH = –log(10–7) = 7\\\\nAcidic solutions possess a concentration\\\\nof hydrogen ions, [H+] > 10–7 M, while basic\\\\nsolutions possess a concentration of hydrogen\\\\nions, [H+] < 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise\\\\nthat\\\\nAcidic solution has pH < 7\\\\nBasic solution has pH > 7\\\\nNeutral solution has pH = 7\\\\nNow again, consider the equation (7.28) at\\\\n298 K\\\\nK w = [H 3 O+] [OH–] = 10–14\\\\nTaking negative logarithm on both sides\\\\nof equation, we obtain\\\\n\\\\n–log K w = – log {[H 3 O+] [OH\\\\n-\\\\n    ]}\\\\n= – log [H 3 O+] – log [OH–]\\\\n= – log 1 0 –14\\\\np K w = pH + pOH = 14 (7.29)\\\\nNote that although K w may change with\\\\ntemperature the variations in pH with\\\\ntemperature are so small that we often\\\\nignore it.\\\\n\\\\np K w is a very important quantity for\\\\naqueous solutions and controls the relative\\\\nconcentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions\\\\nas their product is a constant. It should be\\\\nnoted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, a\\\\n\\\\nchange in pH by just one unit also means\\\\nchange in [H+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when\\\\nthe hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] changes\\\\nby a factor of 100, the value of pH changes by\\\\n2 units. Now you can realise why the change\\\\nin pH with temperature is often ignored.\\\\nMeasurement of pH of a solution is very\\\\nessential as its value should be known when\\\\ndealing with biological and cosmetic\\\\napplications. The pH of a solution can be found\\\\nroughly with the help of pH paper that has\\\\ndifferent colour in solutions of different pH.\\\\nNow-a-days pH paper is available with four\\\\nstrips on it. The different strips have different\\\\ncolours (Fig. 7.11) at the same pH. The pH in\\\\nthe range of 1-14 can be determined with an\\\\naccuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper.\\\\nFig.7.11 pH -paper with four strips that may\\\\nhave different colours at the same pH\\\\nFor greater accuracy pH meters are used.\\\\npH meter is a device that measures the\\\\npH-dependent electrical potential of the test\\\\nsolution within 0.001 precision. pH meters of\\\\nthe size of a writing pen are now available in\\\\nthe market. The pH of some very common\\\\nsubstances are given in Table 7.5 (page 212).\\\\nProblem 7.16\\\\nThe concentration of hydrogen ion in a\\\\nsample of soft drink is 3.8 × 10–3M. what\\\\nis its pH?\\\\nSolution\\\\npH = – log[3.8 × 1 0 –3]\\\\n= – {log[3.8] + log[1 0 –3]}\\\\n= – {(0.58) + (– 3.0)} = – { – 2.42} = 2.42\\\\nTherefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42\\\\nand it can be inferred that it is acidic.\\\\nProblem 7.17\\\\nCalculate pH of a 1.0 × 1 0 –8 M solution\\\\nof HCl.\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 219\\\\n\\\\nTable 7.6 The Ionization Constants of Some\\\\nSelected Weak Acids (at 298K)\\\\nAcid Ionization Constant,\\\\nK a\\\\nHydrofluoric Acid (HF) 3.5 × 1 0 –4\\\\nNitrous Acid (HNO 2 ) 4.5 × 1 0 –4\\\\nFormic Acid (HCOOH) 1.8 × 1 0 –4\\\\nNiacin (C 5 H 4 NCOOH) 1.5 × 1 0 –5\\\\nAcetic Acid (CH 3 COOH) 1.74 × 1 0 –5\\\\nBenzoic Acid (C 6 H 5 COOH) 6.5 × 1 0 –5\\\\nHypochlorous Acid (HCIO) 3.0 × 1 0 –8\\\\nHydrocyanic Acid (HCN) 4.9 × 1 0 –10\\\\nPhenol (C 6 H 5 OH) 1.3 × 1 0 –10\\\\nSolution\\\\n2H 2 O (l) H 3 O+ (aq) + OH\\\\n-\\\\n    (aq)\\\\nK w = [OH–][H 3 O+]\\\\n= 10–14\\\\nLet, x = [OH–] = [H 3 O+] from H 2 O.

The cations/anions formed\\\\n\\\\n226 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\non ionization of salts either exist as hydrated\\\\nions in aqueous solutions or interact with\\\\nwater to reform corresponding acids/bases\\\\ndepending upon the nature of salts. The later\\\\nprocess of interaction between water and\\\\ncations/anions or both of salts is called\\\\nhydrolysis. The pH of the solution gets affected\\\\nby this interaction. The cations (e.g., Na+, K+,\\\\nCa2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases and anions\\\\n(e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO 3 – , ClO 4 – etc.) of strong acids\\\\nsimply get hydrated but do not hydrolyse, and\\\\ntherefore the solutions of salts formed from\\\\nstrong acids and bases are neutral i.e., their\\\\npH is 7. However, the other category of salts\\\\ndo undergo hydrolysis.\\\\n\\\\nWe now consider the hydrolysis of the salts\\\\nof the following types :\\\\n\\\\n(i) salts of weak acid and strong base e.g.,\\\\nCH 3 COONa.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g.,\\\\nNH 4 Cl, and\\\\n\\\\n(iii)salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g.,\\\\nCH 3 COONH 4.\\\\nIn the first case, CH 3 COONa being a salt of\\\\nweak acid, CH 3 COOH and strong base, NaOH\\\\ngets completely ionised in aqueous solution.\\\\n\\\\nCH 3 COONa(aq) → CH 3 COO– (aq)+ Na+(aq)\\\\n\\\\nAcetate ion thus formed undergoes\\\\nhydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and OH–\\\\nions\\\\n\\\\nCH 3 COO–(aq)+H 2 O(l) CH 3 COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)\\\\n\\\\nAcetic acid being a weak acid\\\\n( K a = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in\\\\nsolution. This results in increase of OH– ion\\\\nconcentration in solution making it alkaline.\\\\nThe pH of such a solution is more than 7.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, NH 4 Cl formed from weak base,\\\\nNH 4 OH and strong acid, HCl, in water\\\\ndissociates completely.\\\\n\\\\nNH 4 Cl(aq) → NH+ 4 (aq) +Cl– (aq)\\\\n\\\\nAmmonium ions undergo hydrolysis with\\\\nwater to form NH 4 OH and H+ ions\\\\nNH+ 4 (aq) + H 2 O (1) NH 4 OH(aq) + H+(aq)\\\\nAmmonium hydroxide is a weak base\\\\n( K b = 1.77 × 10–5) and therefore remains almost\\\\nunionised in solution. This results in\\\\n\\\\nincreased of H+ ion concentration in solution\\\\nmaking the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of\\\\nNH 4 Cl solution in water is less than 7.\\\\nConsider the hydrolysis of CH 3 COONH 4 salt\\\\nformed from weak acid and weak base. The\\\\nions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:\\\\nCH 3 COO–^ + NH 4 + + H 2 O CH 3 COOH +\\\\nNH 4 OH\\\\nCH 3 COOH and NH 4 OH, also remain into\\\\npartially dissociated form:\\\\nCH 3 COOH CH 3 COO–^ + H+\\\\nNH 4 OH NH 4 + + OH–\\\\nH 2 O^ H+ + OH–\\\\nWithout going into detailed calculation, it\\\\ncan be said that degree of hydrolysis is\\\\nindependent of concentration of solution, and\\\\npH of such solutions is determined by their p K\\\\nvalues:\\\\npH = 7 + ½ (p K a – p K b) (7.38)\\\\nThe pH of solution can be greater than 7,\\\\nif the difference is positive and it will be less\\\\nthan 7, if the difference is negative.\\\\nProblem 7.25\\\\nThe p K a of acetic acid and p Kb of\\\\nammonium hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75\\\\nrespectively.

It can be defined as a\\\\nshift in equilibrium on adding a substance\\\\nthat provides more of an ionic species already\\\\npresent in the dissociation equilibrium. Thus,\\\\nwe can say that common ion effect is a\\\\nphenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s\\\\nprinciple discussed in section 7.8.\\\\nIn order to evaluate the pH of the solution\\\\nresulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to\\\\n0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider\\\\nthe acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once\\\\nagain,\\\\nHAc(aq) H+(aq) + Ac–(aq)\\\\nInitial concentration (M)\\\\n0.05 0 0.05\\\\nLet x be the extent of ionization of acetic\\\\nacid.\\\\nChange in concentration (M)\\\\n–x +x +x\\\\nEquilibrium concentration (M)\\\\n0.05-x x 0.05+x\\\\nTherefore,\\\\nK a= [H+][Ac– ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)\\\\nAs K a is small for a very weak acid, x<<0.05.\\\\nHence, (0.05 + x) ≈ (0.05 – x) ≈ 0.05\\\\nThus,\\\\n1.8 × 10–5 = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 – x)\\\\n= x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H+] = 1.8 × 10–5M\\\\npH = – log(1.8 × 10–5) = 4.74\\\\nProblem 7.24\\\\nCalculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia\\\\nsolution.

The dissociation constant of\\\\nammonia, K b = 1.77 × 10–5\\\\nSolution\\\\nNH 3 + H 2 O → NH 4 + + OH–\\\\nK b = [NH 4 +][OH–] / [NH 3 ] = 1.77 × 10–5\\\\nBefore neutralization,\\\\n[NH 4 +] = [OH–] = x\\\\n[NH 3 ] = 0.10 – x ∫ 0.10\\\\nx^2 / 0.10 = 1.77 × 10–5\\\\nThus, x = 1.33 × 10–3 = [OH–]\\\\nTherefore,[H+] = K w / [OH–] = 10–14 /\\\\n(1.33 × 10–3) = 7.51 × 10–12\\\\npH = –log(7.5 × 10–12) = 11.12\\\\nOn addition of 25 mL of 0.1M HCl\\\\nsolution (i.e., 2.5 mmol of HCl) to 50 mL\\\\nof 0.1M ammonia solution (i.e., 5 mmol\\\\nof NH 3 ), 2.5 mmol of ammonia molecules\\\\nare neutralized. The resulting 75 mL\\\\nsolution contains the remaining\\\\nunneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH 3 molecules\\\\nand 2.5 mmol of NH 4 +.\\\\nNH 3 + HCl → NH 4 + + Cl–\\\\n2.5 2.5 0 0\\\\nAt equilibrium\\\\n0 0 2.5 2.5\\\\nThe resulting 75 mL of solution contains\\\\n2.5 mmol of NH 4 + ions (i.e., 0.033 M) and\\\\n2.5 mmol (i.e., 0.033 M ) of uneutralised\\\\nNH 3 molecules.

The cations/anions formed\\\\n\\\\n226 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\non ionization of salts either exist as hydrated\\\\nions in aqueous solutions or interact with\\\\nwater to reform corresponding acids/bases\\\\ndepending upon the nature of salts. The later\\\\nprocess of interaction between water and\\\\ncations/anions or both of salts is called\\\\nhydrolysis. The pH of the solution gets affected\\\\nby this interaction. The cations (e.g., Na+, K+,\\\\nCa2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases and anions\\\\n(e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO 3 – , ClO 4 – etc.) of strong acids\\\\nsimply get hydrated but do not hydrolyse, and\\\\ntherefore the solutions of salts formed from\\\\nstrong acids and bases are neutral i.e., their\\\\npH is 7. However, the other category of salts\\\\ndo undergo hydrolysis.\\\\n\\\\nWe now consider the hydrolysis of the salts\\\\nof the following types :\\\\n\\\\n(i) salts of weak acid and strong base e.g.,\\\\nCH 3 COONa.\\\\n\\\\n(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g.,\\\\nNH 4 Cl, and\\\\n\\\\n(iii)salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g.,\\\\nCH 3 COONH 4.\\\\nIn the first case, CH 3 COONa being a salt of\\\\nweak acid, CH 3 COOH and strong base, NaOH\\\\ngets completely ionised in aqueous solution.\\\\n\\\\nCH 3 COONa(aq) → CH 3 COO– (aq)+ Na+(aq)\\\\n\\\\nAcetate ion thus formed undergoes\\\\nhydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and OH–\\\\nions\\\\n\\\\nCH 3 COO–(aq)+H 2 O(l) CH 3 COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)\\\\n\\\\nAcetic acid being a weak acid\\\\n( K a = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in\\\\nsolution. This results in increase of OH– ion\\\\nconcentration in solution making it alkaline.\\\\nThe pH of such a solution is more than 7.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, NH 4 Cl formed from weak base,\\\\nNH 4 OH and strong acid, HCl, in water\\\\ndissociates completely.\\\\n\\\\nNH 4 Cl(aq) → NH+ 4 (aq) +Cl– (aq)\\\\n\\\\nAmmonium ions undergo hydrolysis with\\\\nwater to form NH 4 OH and H+ ions\\\\nNH+ 4 (aq) + H 2 O (1) NH 4 OH(aq) + H+(aq)\\\\nAmmonium hydroxide is a weak base\\\\n( K b = 1.77 × 10–5) and therefore remains almost\\\\nunionised in solution. This results in\\\\n\\\\nincreased of H+ ion concentration in solution\\\\nmaking the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of\\\\nNH 4 Cl solution in water is less than 7.\\\\nConsider the hydrolysis of CH 3 COONH 4 salt\\\\nformed from weak acid and weak base. The\\\\nions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:\\\\nCH 3 COO–^ + NH 4 + + H 2 O CH 3 COOH +\\\\nNH 4 OH\\\\nCH 3 COOH and NH 4 OH, also remain into\\\\npartially dissociated form:\\\\nCH 3 COOH CH 3 COO–^ + H+\\\\nNH 4 OH NH 4 + + OH–\\\\nH 2 O^ H+ + OH–\\\\nWithout going into detailed calculation, it\\\\ncan be said that degree of hydrolysis is\\\\nindependent of concentration of solution, and\\\\npH of such solutions is determined by their p K\\\\nvalues:\\\\npH = 7 + ½ (p K a – p K b) (7.38)\\\\nThe pH of solution can be greater than 7,\\\\nif the difference is positive and it will be less\\\\nthan 7, if the difference is negative.\\\\nProblem 7.25\\\\nThe p K a of acetic acid and p Kb of\\\\nammonium hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75\\\\nrespectively. Calculate the pH of\\\\nammonium acetate solution.\\\\nSolution\\\\npH = 7 + ½ [p K a – p K b]\\\\n= 7 + ½ [4.76 – 4.75]\\\\n= 7 + ½ [0.01] = 7 + 0.005 = 7.005\\\\n\\\\n7.12Buffer Solutions\\\\n\\\\nMany body fluids e.g., blood or urine have\\\\ndefinite pH and any deviation in their pH\\\\nindicates malfunctioning of the body. The\\\\ncontrol of pH is also very important in many\\\\nchemical and biochemical processes. Many\\\\nmedical and cosmetic formulations require\\\\nthat these be kept and administered at a\\\\nparticular pH. The solutions which resist\\\\nchange in pH on dilution or with the\\\\naddition of small amounts of acid or alkali\\\\nare called Buffer Solutions.

Some\\\\nof these (like calcium chloride) are so soluble\\\\nthat they are hygroscopic in nature and even\\\\nabsorb water vapour from atmosphere. Others\\\\n(such as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility\\\\nthat they are commonly termed as insoluble.\\\\nThe solubility depends on a number of factors\\\\nimportant amongst which are the lattice\\\\nenthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy\\\\nof the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve\\\\nin a solvent the strong forces of attraction\\\\nbetween its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be\\\\novercome by the ion-solvent interactions. The\\\\nsolvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in terms\\\\nof solvation which is always negative i.e. energy\\\\nis released in the process of solvation. The\\\\namount of solvation enthalpy depends on the\\\\nnature of the solvent. In case of a non-polar\\\\n(covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is small\\\\nand hence, not sufficient to overcome lattice\\\\nenthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the salt does\\\\nnot dissolve in non-polar solvent. As a general\\\\nrule , for a salt to be able to dissolve in a\\\\nparticular solvent its solvation enthalpy must\\\\nbe greater than its lattice enthalpy so that the\\\\nlatter may be overcome by former. Each salt has\\\\nits characteristic solubility which depends on\\\\ntemperature. We classify salts on the basis of\\\\ntheir solubility in the following three categories.\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 229\\\\n\\\\nA solid salt of the general formula\\\\nM Xxp+ yq−with molar solubility S in equilibrium\\\\nwith its saturated solution may be represented\\\\nby the equation:\\\\nMxXy(s) xMp+(aq) + yXq– (aq)\\\\n(where x × p+ = y × q–)\\\\nAnd its solubility product constant is given\\\\nby:\\\\nK sp = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y (7.44)\\\\n= xx. yy. S(x + y)\\\\nS(x + y) = K sp / xx. yy\\\\nS = ( K sp / xx. yy)1 / x + y (7.45)\\\\nThe term K sp in equation is given by Q sp\\\\n(section 7.6.2) when the concentration of one\\\\nor more species is not the concentration under\\\\nequilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium\\\\nconditions K sp = Q sp but otherwise it gives the\\\\ndirection of the processes of precipitation or\\\\ndissolution. The solubility product constants\\\\nof a number of common salts at 298K are given\\\\nin Table 7.9.\\\\nTable 7.9 The Solubility Product Constants,\\\\nK sp of Some Common Ionic Salts at\\\\n298K.\\\\nProblem 7.26\\\\nCalculate the solubility of A 2 X 3 in pure\\\\nwater, assuming that neither kind of ion\\\\nreacts with water.

Similarly,\\\\nif the concentration of one of the ions is\\\\ndecreased, more salt will dissolve to increase\\\\nthe concentration of both the ions till once\\\\nagain K sp = Q sp. This is applicable even to\\\\nsoluble salts like sodium chloride except that\\\\ndue to higher concentrations of the ions, we\\\\nuse their activities instead of their molarities\\\\nin the expression for Q sp. Thus if we take a\\\\nsaturated solution of sodium chloride and\\\\npass HCl gas through it, then sodium chloride\\\\nis precipitated due to increased concentration\\\\n(activity) of chloride ion available from the\\\\ndissociation of HCl. Sodium chloride thus\\\\nobtained is of very high purity and we can get\\\\nrid of impurities like sodium and magnesium\\\\nsulphates. The common ion effect is also used\\\\nfor almost complete precipitation of a particular\\\\nion as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low\\\\nvalue of solubility product for gravimetric\\\\nestimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion\\\\nas silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide\\\\n(or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as\\\\nits sulphate for quantitative estimations.\\\\n\\\\nDissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH) 2 provides\\\\nS mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but\\\\nthe total concentration of OH– = (0.10 +\\\\n2S) mol/L because the solution already\\\\ncontains 0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.\\\\nK sp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]^2\\\\n= (S) (0.10 + 2S)^2\\\\nAs K sp is small, 2S << 0.10,\\\\nthus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10\\\\nHence,\\\\n2.0 × 10–15 = S (0.10)^2\\\\nS = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]\\\\nThe solubility of salts of weak acids like\\\\nphosphates increases at lower pH. This is\\\\nbecause at lower pH the concentration of the\\\\nanion decreases due to its protonation. This\\\\nin turn increase the solubility of the salt so\\\\nthat K sp = Q sp. We have to satisfy two equilibria\\\\nsimultaneously i.e.,\\\\nK sp = [M+] [X–],\\\\n[X–] / [HX] = K a / [H+]\\\\nTaking inverse of both side and adding 1\\\\nwe get\\\\nHX\\\\nX\\\\n\\\\nHX H\\\\n\\\\na\\\\na\\\\na\\\\n[ ]\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n+ =\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n[ ]+\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb+\\\\n\\\\n−\\\\n+\\\\n−\\\\n−\\\\n+\\\\n\\\\n1 1\\\\n\\\\nNow, again taking inverse, we get\\\\n[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = K a / ( K a + [H+]) and it\\\\ncan be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases. If\\\\nS is the solubility of the salt at a given pH then\\\\nK sp = [S] [f S] = S^2 { K a / ( K a + [H+])} and\\\\nS = { K sp ([H+] + K a ) / K a }1/2^ (7.46)\\\\nThus solubility S increases with increase\\\\nin [H+] or decrease in pH.\\\\nProblem 7.28\\\\nCalculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH) 2\\\\nin 0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of\\\\nNi(OH) 2 is 2.0 × 10–15.\\\\nSolution\\\\nLet the solubility of Ni(OH) 2 be equal to S.\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 231\\\\n\\\\nSUMMARY\\\\nWhen the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of\\\\nmolecules returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is\\\\ndynamic in nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical\\\\nprocesses and at this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium\\\\nconstant, Kc is expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each\\\\nterm raised to the stoichiometric coefficient.\\\\nFor reaction, a A + b B c C +d D\\\\nK c = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b\\\\nEquilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage\\\\nall the macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant.\\\\nFor a gaseous reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing\\\\nconcentration terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can\\\\nbe predicted by reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s\\\\nprinciple states that the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure,\\\\nconcentration, etc. will cause the equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce\\\\nor counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various\\\\nfactors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the\\\\ndirection of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors.\\\\nCatalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases\\\\nthe rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for\\\\nconversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.\\\\nAll substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes.\\\\nAcids, bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous\\\\nsolutions is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of\\\\nelectrolytes in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In\\\\nweak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte\\\\nmolecules. According to Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce\\\\nhydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. Brönsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined\\\\nan acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry\\\\nacid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding\\\\nto the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate pair of acid-base differs only by one\\\\nproton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an acid as an electron pair acceptor\\\\nand a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization (equilibrium)\\\\nconstants of weak acids ( K a) and weak bases ( K b) are developed using Arrhenius definition.\\\\nThe degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are\\\\ndiscussed. The pH scale (pH = -log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration (activity) has\\\\nbeen introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]) ; p K a = –log[Ka] ;\\\\np K b = –log[ K b]; and p K w = –log[ K w] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and\\\\nwe note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid\\\\nand weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo\\\\nhydrolysis in aqueous solution.The definition of buffer solutions, and their importance\\\\nare discussed briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed\\\\nand the equilibrium constant is introduced as solubility product constant ( K sp). Its\\\\nrelationship with solubility of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of\\\\nthe salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of\\\\ncommon ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.\\\\n\\\\n232 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nSUGGESTED ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS REGARDING THIS UNIT\\\\n(a) The student may use pH paper in determining the pH of fresh juices of various\\\\nvegetables and fruits, soft drinks, body fluids and also that of water samples available.\\\\n(b) The pH paper may also be used to determine the pH of different salt solutions and\\\\nfrom that he/she may determine if these are formed from strong/weak acids and\\\\nbases.\\\\n(c) They may prepare some buffer solutions by mixing the solutions of sodium acetate\\\\nand acetic acid and determine their pH using pH paper.\\\\n(d) They may be provided with different indicators to observe their colours in solutions\\\\nof varying pH.\\\\n(e) They may perform some acid-base titrations using indicators.\\\\n(f) They may observe common ion effect on the solubility of sparingly soluble salts.\\\\n(g) If pH meter is available in their school, they may measure the pH with it and compare\\\\nthe results obtained with that of the pH paper.\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n7.1 A liquid is in equilibrium with its vapour in a sealed container at a fixed\\\\ntemperature.

We classify salts on the basis of\\\\ntheir solubility in the following three categories.\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 229\\\\n\\\\nA solid salt of the general formula\\\\nM Xxp+ yq−with molar solubility S in equilibrium\\\\nwith its saturated solution may be represented\\\\nby the equation:\\\\nMxXy(s) xMp+(aq) + yXq– (aq)\\\\n(where x × p+ = y × q–)\\\\nAnd its solubility product constant is given\\\\nby:\\\\nK sp = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y (7.44)\\\\n= xx. yy. S(x + y)\\\\nS(x + y) = K sp / xx. yy\\\\nS = ( K sp / xx. yy)1 / x + y (7.45)\\\\nThe term K sp in equation is given by Q sp\\\\n(section 7.6.2) when the concentration of one\\\\nor more species is not the concentration under\\\\nequilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium\\\\nconditions K sp = Q sp but otherwise it gives the\\\\ndirection of the processes of precipitation or\\\\ndissolution. The solubility product constants\\\\nof a number of common salts at 298K are given\\\\nin Table 7.9.\\\\nTable 7.9 The Solubility Product Constants,\\\\nK sp of Some Common Ionic Salts at\\\\n298K.\\\\nProblem 7.26\\\\nCalculate the solubility of A 2 X 3 in pure\\\\nwater, assuming that neither kind of ion\\\\nreacts with water. The solubility product\\\\nof A 2 X 3 , K sp = 1.1 × 10–23.\\\\nSolution\\\\nA 2 X 3 → 2A3+ + 3X2–\\\\nK sp = [A3+]^2 [X2–]^3 = 1.1 × 10–23\\\\nIf S = solubility of A 2 X 3 , then\\\\n[A3+] = 2S; [X2–] = 3S\\\\ntherefore, K sp = (2S)^2 (3S)^3 = 108S^5\\\\n= 1.1 × 10–23\\\\nthus, S^5 = 1 × 10–25\\\\nS = 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L.\\\\nProblem 7.27\\\\nThe values of K sp of two sparingly soluble\\\\nsalts Ni(OH) 2 and AgCN are 2.0 × 10–15\\\\nand 6 × 0–17 respectively.

Similarly,\\\\nif the concentration of one of the ions is\\\\ndecreased, more salt will dissolve to increase\\\\nthe concentration of both the ions till once\\\\nagain K sp = Q sp. This is applicable even to\\\\nsoluble salts like sodium chloride except that\\\\ndue to higher concentrations of the ions, we\\\\nuse their activities instead of their molarities\\\\nin the expression for Q sp. Thus if we take a\\\\nsaturated solution of sodium chloride and\\\\npass HCl gas through it, then sodium chloride\\\\nis precipitated due to increased concentration\\\\n(activity) of chloride ion available from the\\\\ndissociation of HCl. Sodium chloride thus\\\\nobtained is of very high purity and we can get\\\\nrid of impurities like sodium and magnesium\\\\nsulphates. The common ion effect is also used\\\\nfor almost complete precipitation of a particular\\\\nion as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low\\\\nvalue of solubility product for gravimetric\\\\nestimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion\\\\nas silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide\\\\n(or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as\\\\nits sulphate for quantitative estimations.\\\\n\\\\nDissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH) 2 provides\\\\nS mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but\\\\nthe total concentration of OH– = (0.10 +\\\\n2S) mol/L because the solution already\\\\ncontains 0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.\\\\nK sp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]^2\\\\n= (S) (0.10 + 2S)^2\\\\nAs K sp is small, 2S << 0.10,\\\\nthus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10\\\\nHence,\\\\n2.0 × 10–15 = S (0.10)^2\\\\nS = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]\\\\nThe solubility of salts of weak acids like\\\\nphosphates increases at lower pH. This is\\\\nbecause at lower pH the concentration of the\\\\nanion decreases due to its protonation. This\\\\nin turn increase the solubility of the salt so\\\\nthat K sp = Q sp. We have to satisfy two equilibria\\\\nsimultaneously i.e.,\\\\nK sp = [M+] [X–],\\\\n[X–] / [HX] = K a / [H+]\\\\nTaking inverse of both side and adding 1\\\\nwe get\\\\nHX\\\\nX\\\\n\\\\nHX H\\\\n\\\\na\\\\na\\\\na\\\\n[ ]\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n+ =\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n[ ]+\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb\\\\n\\\\n\\\\uf8ee\\\\uf8f0 \\\\uf8f9\\\\uf8fb+\\\\n\\\\n−\\\\n+\\\\n−\\\\n−\\\\n+\\\\n\\\\n1 1\\\\n\\\\nNow, again taking inverse, we get\\\\n[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = K a / ( K a + [H+]) and it\\\\ncan be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases. If\\\\nS is the solubility of the salt at a given pH then\\\\nK sp = [S] [f S] = S^2 { K a / ( K a + [H+])} and\\\\nS = { K sp ([H+] + K a ) / K a }1/2^ (7.46)\\\\nThus solubility S increases with increase\\\\nin [H+] or decrease in pH.\\\\nProblem 7.28\\\\nCalculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH) 2\\\\nin 0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of\\\\nNi(OH) 2 is 2.0 × 10–15.\\\\nSolution\\\\nLet the solubility of Ni(OH) 2 be equal to S.\\\\n\\\\nEQUILIBRIUM 231\\\\n\\\\nSUMMARY\\\\nWhen the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of\\\\nmolecules returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is\\\\ndynamic in nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical\\\\nprocesses and at this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium\\\\nconstant, Kc is expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each\\\\nterm raised to the stoichiometric coefficient.\\\\nFor reaction, a A + b B c C +d D\\\\nK c = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b\\\\nEquilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage\\\\nall the macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant.\\\\nFor a gaseous reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing\\\\nconcentration terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can\\\\nbe predicted by reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s\\\\nprinciple states that the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure,\\\\nconcentration, etc. will cause the equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce\\\\nor counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various\\\\nfactors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the\\\\ndirection of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors.\\\\nCatalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases\\\\nthe rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for\\\\nconversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.\\\\nAll substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes.\\\\nAcids, bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous\\\\nsolutions is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of\\\\nelectrolytes in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In\\\\nweak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte\\\\nmolecules. According to Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce\\\\nhydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. Brönsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined\\\\nan acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry\\\\nacid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding\\\\nto the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate pair of acid-base differs only by one\\\\nproton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an acid as an electron pair acceptor\\\\nand a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization (equilibrium)\\\\nconstants of weak acids ( K a) and weak bases ( K b) are developed using Arrhenius definition.\\\\nThe degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are\\\\ndiscussed. The pH scale (pH = -log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration (activity) has\\\\nbeen introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]) ; p K a = –log[Ka] ;\\\\np K b = –log[ K b]; and p K w = –log[ K w] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and\\\\nwe note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid\\\\nand weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo\\\\nhydrolysis in aqueous solution.The definition of buffer solutions, and their importance\\\\nare discussed briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed\\\\nand the equilibrium constant is introduced as solubility product constant ( K sp). Its\\\\nrelationship with solubility of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of\\\\nthe salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of\\\\ncommon ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.\\\\n\\\\n232 CHEMISTRY\\\\n\\\\nSUGGESTED ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS REGARDING THIS UNIT\\\\n(a) The student may use pH paper in determining the pH of fresh juices of various\\\\nvegetables and fruits, soft drinks, body fluids and also that of water samples available.\\\\n(b) The pH paper may also be used to determine the pH of different salt solutions and\\\\nfrom that he/she may determine if these are formed from strong/weak acids and\\\\nbases.\\\\n(c) They may prepare some buffer solutions by mixing the solutions of sodium acetate\\\\nand acetic acid and determine their pH using pH paper.\\\\n(d) They may be provided with different indicators to observe their colours in solutions\\\\nof varying pH.\\\\n(e) They may perform some acid-base titrations using indicators.\\\\n(f) They may observe common ion effect on the solubility of sparingly soluble salts.\\\\n(g) If pH meter is available in their school, they may measure the pH with it and compare\\\\nthe results obtained with that of the pH paper.\\\\nEXERCISES\\\\n7.1 A liquid is in equilibrium with its vapour in a sealed container at a fixed\\\\ntemperature.
